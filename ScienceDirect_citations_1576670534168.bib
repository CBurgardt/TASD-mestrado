abstract = "The objective of Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous computing. As a result many computing enabled, connected devices are deployed in various environments, where these devices keep generating unbounded event streams related to the deployed environment. The common paradigm is to process these event streams at the cloud using the available Distributed Stream Processing (DSP) frameworks. However, with the emergence of Edge Computing, another convenient computing paradigm has been presented for executing such applications. Edge computing introduces the concept of using the underutilised potential of a large number of computing enabled connected devices such as IoT, located outside the cloud. In order to develop optimal strategies to utilise this vast number of potential resources, a realistic test bed is required. However, due to the overwhelming scale and heterogeneity of the edge computing device deployments, the amount of effort and investment required to set up such an environment is high. Therefore, a realistic simulation environment that can accurately predict the behaviour and performance of a large-scale, real deployment is extremely valuable. While the state-of-the-art simulation tools consider different aspects of executing applications on edge or cloud computing environments, we found that no simulator considers all the key characteristics to perform a realistic simulation of the execution of DSP applications on edge and cloud computing environments. To the best of our knowledge, the publicly available simulators lack being verified against real world experimental measurements, i.e. for calibration and to obtain accurate estimates of e.g. latency and power consumption. In this paper, we present our ECSNeT++ simulation toolkit which has been verified using real world experimental measurements for executing DSP applications on edge and cloud computing environments. ECSNeT++ models deployment and processing of DSP applications on edge-cloud environments and is built on top of OMNeT++/INET. By using multiple configurations of two real DSP applications, we show that ECSNeT++ is able to model a real deployment, with proper calibration. We believe that with the public availability of ECSNeT++ as an open source framework, and the verified accuracy of our results, ECSNeT++ can be used effectively for predicting the behaviour and performance of DSP applications running on large scale, heterogeneous edge and cloud computing device deployments."

abstract = "In several domains, including healthcare and home automation, it is important to unobtrusively monitor the activities of daily living (ADLs) carried out by people at home. A popular approach consists in the use of sensors attached to everyday objects to capture user interaction, and ADL models to recognize the current activity based on the temporal sequence of used objects. Often, ADL models are automatically extracted from labeled datasets of activities and sensor events, using supervised learning techniques. Unfortunately, acquiring such datasets in smart homes is expensive and violates users’ privacy. Hence, an alternative solution consists in manually defining ADL models based on common sense, exploiting logic languages such as description logics. However, manual specification of ADL ontologies is cumbersome, and rigid ontological definitions fail to capture the variability of activity execution. In this paper, we introduce a radically new approach enabled by the recent proliferation of tagged visual contents available on the Web. Indeed, thanks to the popularity of social network applications, people increasingly share pictures and videos taken during the execution of every kind of activity. Often, shared contents are tagged with metadata, manually specified by their owners, that concisely describe the depicted activity. Those metadata represent an implicit activity label of the picture or video. Moreover, today’s computer vision tools support accurate extraction of tags describing the situation and the objects that appear in the visual content. By reasoning with those tags and their corresponding activity labels, we can reconstruct accurate models of a comprehensive set of human activities executed in the most disparate situations. This approach overcomes the main shortcomings of existing techniques. Compared to supervised learning methods, it does not require the acquisition of training sets of sensor events and activities. Compared to knowledge-based methods, it does not involve any manual modeling effort, and it captures a comprehensive array of execution modalities. Through extensive experiments with large datasets of real-world ADLs, we show that this approach is practical and effective."

Therefore, meeting the need for personalized visual comfort whilst achieving energy efficiency in open-plan office environment has been an open challenge. However, recent technological advancements in distributed sensing, pervasive computing, context-awareness and machine learning is progressively closing this gap. This article introduces ReViCEE–a simple recommender systems based approach to learn both individual and collaborative user-preferences from historical data and offer recommendations for intelligent building lighting controls. The intelligence in this case is achieved by being able to derive set-points to control task lights such that it balances personalized visual comfort without compromising on energy savings. The proposed approach has been developed using Python and implemented on a real test-bed in an university campus office building in National University of Singapore. The evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out for two months using field experiments involving distributed wireless sensor actuator network (WSAN) and multiple occupants having varied visual sensation. The novelty lies in proposing a new inter-disciplinary approach that supports smart and intelligent buildings paradigm by learning and predicting optimum individual user-preferences towards energy efficient control of personalized light. The results obtained from field experiments present a potential energy savings upto 72% when compared to the conventional lighting systems used."

Pervasive computing applications can be formulated on top of the IoT involving nodes that can interact with their environment and perform various processing tasks. Any task is part of intelligent services executed in nodes or the back end infrastructure for supporting end users’ applications. In this setting, one can identify the need for applying updates in the software/firmware of the autonomous nodes. Updates are extensions or patches significant for the efficient functioning of nodes. Legacy methodologies deal with centralized approaches where complex protocols are adopted to support the distribution of the updates in the entire network. In this paper, we depart from the relevant literature and propose a distributed model where each node is responsible to, independently, initiate and conclude the update process. Nodes monitor a set of metrics related to their load and the performance of the network and through a time-optimized scheme identify the appropriate time to conclude the update process. We report on an infinite horizon optimal stopping model on top of the collected performance data. The aim is to make nodes capable of identifying when their performance and the performance of the network are of high quality to efficiently conclude the update process.

abstract = "Many of the existing management platforms such as pervasive computing systems implement policies that depend on dynamic operational environment changes. Existing formal approaches for automatically enforcing access control policies are primarily expressed in conventional logic programming, also known as monotonic logics, e.g., First Order Logic (FOL). The major issue with monotonic logics is that they are not devised to invalidate initial believes in the light of further observations. This limitation makes these traditional logical approaches less suitable for modeling and analyzing context-aware access control policies, where exceptional policies are introduced incrementally and adaptively during runtime. The inability to invalidate initial policies when an exception needs to be enforced might result in inconsistencies and violations that need to be resolved manually by human entities. To address the problems with conventional logical approaches and more importantly prevent such inconsistencies, this paper presents a non-monotonic logic-based reasoning scheme for modeling and analyzing adaptive access control policies. In the proposed formalism, unavailable context data and incomplete access control policies can be explicitly expressed. To do so, the paper distinguishes three kinds of policies: default, context-dependent and exception policies. The proposed formalism is based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), a non-monotonic logic programming language that allows elegant representation of unavailability of context data in adaptive systems. We devise non-monotonic policy inference rules such that, when exception policies are defined, they take precedence over default and context-dependent policies automatically. The results of two case studies are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed policy representation scheme compared to the Organizational-Based Access Control (OrBAC) model."

Every node acts autonomously and monitors the network's performance to find a slot where performance parameters advocate for an efficient and uninterrupted conclusion of the update task.

Objective
The goal of this paper is to support the increased demands of scalability, flexibility, autonomy, and heterogeneity for IoT event processing. A distributed architectural model based on Situational Awareness, named EXEHDA-SA, was designed to provide event collection, hybrid processing, and customizable and dynamic reaction features.
Method
The conception of the model was based on a middleware for ubiquitous computing called EXEHDA, thus benefiting from its already defined strategies. The proposal follows a multi-level strategy and consists of three hierarchically interconnected modular components.
Results
Our main contribution is the conception and validation of a model for event collection, processing and reaction for modern distributed environments. The contribution is evidenced through experiments performed on a prototype implemented on consolidated free and open source technologies. The experiments are made up of five case studies where each one evaluates a scenario for IoT demands.
Conclusion
Through these case studies which were proposed in information security area, we demonstrated the feasibility of this proposal for deployment in IoT production environments. Furthermore, EXEHDA-SA is able to operate on different scenarios due to each component modularity and its consequent extensibility."

Further, connected “things” can be used as physical interfaces to enable users to cooperate, leveraging multiple devices via parallel and distributed actions. Yet creating prototypes of IoT systems is a complex task for developers non-expert in IoT, as it requires dealing with multi-layered hardware and software infrastructures.

Our solution abstracts low-level details and communication protocols, allowing developers non-expert in IoT to focus on application logic, facilitating rapid prototyping. RapIoT supports the development of collaborative applications by enabling the definition of high-level data type primitives and allowing interactions spread among multiple smart objects. RapIoT primitives act as a loosely coupled interface between generic IoT devices and applications, simplifying the development of systems that make use of an ecology of devices distributed to multiple users and environments. We illustrate the potential of our toolkit by presenting the development process of an IoT application ideated during a workshop with non-expert developers and addressing real-world challenges affecting smart cities.

Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability."

The implementation of such services not only increases the coverage and quality of healthcare facilities, but their adoption in disaster medical delivery could save time, money, and lives. The term Ubiquitous Computing implies the presence of interconnected hardware and software systems, whose presence is not identified. The technology is pervasive, yet invisible to enable people to go about their daily life activities and their interactions with the environment, without being distracted by the technology surrounding them. To achieve this, multiple wearable physiological monitoring devices, Internet of things-based architectures, and participatory sensing systems have been developed. However, with such constant monitoring, the healthcare data get increasingly big and more difficult to process. Moreover, since daily life activities are composite in nature, they could be part of more complex routines and behaviors, and precise, instance-wise labels are difficult to create. Instance-wise labeling for multiple activities, along with the sequence of the activities for every individual window, is required for proper predictions. This chapter explores the applications and challenges in U-healthcare systems while analyzing secure architectures to resolve certain specific issues in this area of research. Further, advanced data processing techniques are studied for accurate labeling and prediction of possible health issues based on previous data accumulated through various resources, such as prior health records and incoming data through sensor networks."

In the literature, most reasoning approaches for HAR are based on centralized approach where a central system is responsible for processing and reasoning about sensor data in order to recognize activities. Since sensor data are distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic (i.e., whose characteristics are varying over time) in the smart home, reasoning process on these data for HAR needs to be distributed over a group of heterogeneous, autonomous and interacting entities in order to be more efficient. This paper proposes a main contribution, the DCR approach, a fully Distributed Collaborative Reasoning multi-agent approach where agents, with diverse classifiers, observe sensor data, make local predictions, communicate and collaborate to identify current activities. Then, an improved version of the DCR approach is proposed, the DCR-OL approach, a distributed Online Learning approach where learning agents learns from their collaborations to improve their own performance in activity recognition. Finally, we test our approaches by performing an evaluation study on Aruba dataset, that indicates an enhancement in terms of accuracy, F-measure and G-mean metrics compared to the centralized approach and also compared to a distributed approach existing in the literature."

Patient-related data have provided insights (real world data) into understanding the disease processes. Advanced analytics have refined these insights further to draw dynamic algorithms aiding clinicians in making more accurate diagnosis with the help of machine learning. AI is another tool, which, although is still in the evolution stage, has the potential to help identify early signs even before the clinical features are apparent. The evolving digital developments pose challenges on allowing access to health-related data for further research but, at the same time, protecting each patient's privacy. This review focuses on the recent technological advances and their applications and highlights the immense potential to enable early diagnosis of rheumatological diseases."

This has resulted in numerous research works addressing ABS in civilian UAV applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ABS contribution in civilian UAV applications by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the relevant research in the previous ten years. Following the SLR methodology, this objective is broken down into several research questions aiming to (i) understand the evolution of ABS use in civilian UAV applications and identify the related hot research topics, (ii) identify the underlying artificial intelligence systems used in the literature, (iii) understand how and when ABS is integrated in broader and more complex internet of things & ubiquitous computing environments, and (iv) identity the communication technologies, tools, and evaluation techniques used to design, implement, and test the proposed ABS models. From the SLR results, key research directions are highlighted including problems related to autonomy, explainability, security, flight duration, integration within smart cities, regulations, and validation & verification of the UAV behavior."

In an environment of ubiquitous computing and information, information's value takes on a new dimension. Moreover, when the system in which such a volume of information exists is itself intelligent, the ability to elicit value, with consideration of context, will be more complicated. Classical economic theory describes the relationship between value and volume which, though moderated by demand, is highly correlated. In an environment where information is plentiful, such as the IoT, the intrinsic intelligence in the system will be a dominant moderator of demand (e.g., self-adapting, self-operating, and self-protecting; controlling access). We examine Howard's (1966) VoI theory from this perspective and illustrate mathematically that Howard's focus on maximizing value obfuscates another important dimension, the guarantee of minimal value."

AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) enables integration of new technologies to be part of our daily life activities. In this paper, we have provided a novel smart healthcare framework for AAL to monitor the physical activities of elderly people using IoMT and intelligent machine learning algorithms for faster analysis, decision making and better treatment recommendations. Data is collected from multiple wearable sensors placed on subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest, is transmitted through IoMT devices to the integrated cloud and data analytics layer. To process huge amounts of data in parallel, Hadoop MapReduce techniques are used. Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, which fits into the MapReduce paradigm, is utilized to recognize the motion experienced by different body parts and provides higher scalability and better performance with parallel processing when compared to serial processor. Our proposed framework predicts 12 physical activities with an overall accuracy of 97.1%. This can be considered as an optimal solution for recognizing physical activities to remotely monitor health conditions of elderly people."

We outline the basic components required and essential for the same. We believe that a context-aware ecosystem becomes effective when these components are designed and implemented effectively. We call it the MOM of context-aware systems: generic and effective context Modeling, an efficient context Organization, and a robust context Middleware. Context modeling affords a syntax to the raw pieces of relevant information, the organization mechanism furnishes semantic import to the information and relationships, and the middleware compiles and integrates the information, enabling sharing of context. We discuss various context-aware ecosystems and middleware from the literature and highlight how the three building components function in each case.

Currently, most sensor-based activity recognition techniques rely on supervised learning algorithms. However, the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities in smart homes is expensive and violates the individual’s privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel hybrid approach that couples collaborative active learning with probabilistic and knowledge-based reasoning. The rationale of our approach is that a generic, and possibly incomplete, knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method exploiting users’ feedback to (i) refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology, and (ii) mine temporal patterns of sensor events that are frequently generated by the execution of specific activities. A Markov Logic Network is used to recognize activities with probabilistic rules that capture both the ontological knowledge and the information obtained by active learning. We experimented our solution with a real-world dataset of activities carried out by several individuals in an interleaved fashion. Experimental results show that our collaborative and personalized active learning solution significantly improves recognition rates, while triggering a small number of feedback requests. Moreover, the overall recognition rates compare favorably with existing supervised and unsupervised activity recognition methods."

We propose a self-adaptive pervasive fall detection approach that is robust to the heterogeneity of real life situations. Using the data of four publicly available datasets, we show that our system is not only robust regarding the different dimensions of heterogeneity, but also adapts autonomously to spontaneous changes in the sensor’s position at runtime. In this paper, we extend our self-adaptive fall detection system with (i) additional algorithms for fall detection, (ii) an approach for cross-positional sensor fusion, (iii) a fall detection approach that relies on outlier detection, and (iv) a smart fall alert.

Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) seeks to overcome the issues by following the idea of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The CaaS delivery model attempts to separate context service consumers from context service providers. However, CaaS shifts the complexities of context service provisioning and management from consumers toward providers. Considering the merits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in coping with the complexities of problems in different domains, we leverage MDD in the CaaS domain and propose the CaaSSET framework to ease the development of context services. A prerequisite for realizing this aim is to specify the CaaS domain as a meta-model. Our CaaSSET framework consists of a CaaS reference model, a context service meta-model, a graphical modeling tool, a code generation tool, and a context service management tool. Using CaaSSET, the context services are modeled in a graphical environment and transformed into executable context web services (semi-) automatically. To evaluate the applicability of the CaaSSET framework, we have modeled and developed a tourism context service as a case study. We have also compared the framework with the related work based on 44 evaluation criteria, which we have extracted from 14 context service requirements."

Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks. This paper surveys the recent advance of deep learning based sensor-based activity recognition. We summarize existing literature from three aspects: sensor modality, deep model, and application. We also present detailed insights on existing work and propose grand challenges for future research."

Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text.

HAR relies on the machine learning models trained using sufficient activity data. However, when the labels from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) are missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help recognize the activities of this position? This problem can be divided into two steps. Firstly, when there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. Secondly, with the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains in order to recognize the activities on the target domain. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a Stratified Transfer Learning (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and activity transfer. STL is based on our proposed Stratified distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: 1) Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS), which can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; and 2) Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT), which is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL."

Topic modeling methods were used to identify six key themes (topics) of WAT research, namely: (1) Technology Focus, (2) Patient Treatment and Medical Settings, (3) Behavior Change, (4) Acceptance and Adoption (Abandonment), (5) Self-monitoring Data Centered, and (6) Privacy. We take an interdisciplinary approach to wearable activity trackers to propose several new research questions. The most important research gap we identify is to attempt to understand the rich human-information interaction that is enabled by WAT adoption."

abstract = "Context-awareness is an important research area. Many energy efficiency applications of ubiquitous computing need to access some related contexts to provide the best and adequate energy saving services at the right time and at the right place. One of the big challenges is the difficulty and the complexity to make systems identify and understand situations in the building business, especially in complex situations to provide adequate energy-saving services for each of which. This issue is divided into two parts: On one hand, the smart building and its environment must be modeled in a way that provides context-awareness. On the other hand is the how to effectively exploit this context-awareness to reduce energy consumption and increase the user comfort. In this paper, we propose an intelligent context-awareness Building Energy Management System (ICA-BEMS). ICA-BEMS uses hybrid energy-saving techniques based on a Smart Context-Awareness Management (Smart-CAM). Smart-CAM uses smart building ontology to organize smart building knowledge and utilizes a new context-awareness mechanism to provide contextual information. The former exploits the contextual information in reasoning to reduce the building energy consumption, promoting users behavioral change and maximizing the user's comfort to bring about a better energy efficiency policy. To evaluate our system, we have developed a smart building simulator (Open-SBS) which simulates smart building comportments and human behaviors. We have created various scenarios of daily life in the smart building simulator. We have tested our ICA-BEMS effect on energy consumption having a positive result. Energy consumption has been decreased by 40% of total energy consumption."

abstract = "Advances in modern technology, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous computing, open up new exciting opportunities for technology for animals. This is evidenced by the explosion of products and gadgets available for pets, digital enrichment for captive animals in zoos, sensor based smart farming, etc. At the same time, the emerging discipline of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) marks a new era in the design and development of animal technologies, promoting a more animal-centric approach, considering the needs of the animal in the development process. In this article, we reflect on the ways in which ideas of animal-centric development may impact the development of technology for animals in practice. We start by looking at the process of development for and with animals, and propose a development model facilitating the principles of Agility, Welfare of Animals, and eXperts’ involvement (AWAX) within the development lifecycle. While promoting the animal-centric approach, it is important to acknowledge that an animal usually uses technology through humans and in a particular environment. We further extend the AWAX model to include considerations of the human in the loop and the environment, and discuss some practical implications of this view, including aspects such as security and privacy."
