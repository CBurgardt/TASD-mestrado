A User-centric Service Framework for Pervasive Computing,2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"In pervasive computing environments, users can interact with a wide range of services, but which do not include legacy application services such as interactive desktop applications. How to use legacy service as a kind of transparent service mechanism in a pervasive computing environment is an important problem to solve during the transition from personal computing to pervasive computing. This paper presents a user-centric service framework that coordinates application services over network and heterogeneous networked devices nearby users to form a user's virtual computing environment. It also provides legacy support without modification to existing softwares based on virtual desktop and virtual device"
A Scalable Pervasive Computing Architecture for Hospital Information System Based on Multi-weight Virtual Machine,2008 Third International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2008,"A new multi-weight virtual machine based on pervasive computing architecture has been introduced to support the future hospital information system in pervasive computing age. In this architecture, four running modes are defined according to the terminal's hardware performance and the weight of the applications.

Compared with the traditional PC-based architecture, VM-based architecture has many advantages in TCO, manageability and availability."
Research on Spatial Location Unit Distribution Model in Pervasive Computing,2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education,2009,"How to obtain location information of an unknown node precisely is a key problem of locating service under ubiquitous computing environment. The paper proposes and proves the theorem of spatial location unit distribution model according to the analysis of the location error produced during location using the polygon location method in the three-dimensional space. On this basis, the location unit selection (LUS) algorithm is proposed by improving on the traditional polygon location algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the location unit distribution model theorem and the LUS algorithm can meet the requirements of a ubiquitous terminalpsilas real-time location and possess a preferable precision in location."
Ubiquitous Computing: Are We There Yet?,,2010,"The widespread deployment of technologies like mobile phones continues to drive new applications and to open research opportunities. This article talks about ubiquitous computing and how people understand and interact with computing. Pervasive computing technologies are transparent to users until the system malfunctions. Minor breakdowns are common, and people get used to them. However, when breakdowns affect ubiquitous systems that have evolved into megautilities, like mobile communication and data networks, we realize just how dependent we have become on the technology."
"Pervasive Computing: Implications, Opportunities and Challenges for the Society",2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"Summary form only given. Pervasive computing, also referred to sometimes as ubiquitous computing deals with the idea of making ""computing power"" available anyplace, anytime in a uniform way so that it may be exploited for meeting the challenges faced by society. The obvious analogy to this is the electric power infrastructures, which made the society's work and play more effective and enjoyable. Can pervasive computing also have a similar or greater impact on society? The answer is undoubtedly a resounding yes. However, we have a long way to go and overcome many a challenge. In this talk, we discuss these issues: the implications, opportunities and challenges pervasive computing. There have been steady advances in the area of computing hardware contributing to the dramatic affordability of computers. The revolution brought about by the Internet and the liberalization of the communications industry has brought the world closer. Now, it is no longer possible to even define what device may be termed a computer as ""computing"" becomes embedded in everyday appliances large and small ranging from cars to washing machines. The merger of computing and communications together with miniaturization is leading the way. However, for the promise of pervasive computing to frilly materialize, technology and support structures need to advance along four directions: computing, communication, cognition, and collaboration - the 4Cs of pervasive computing. Among the 4Cs the first two: computing and communications are rapidly advancing especially with the introduction of GPS as an embedded service. For a user to truly benefit from pervasive computing, the first two Cs are not enough. The supporting systems need to exhibit cognition - an understanding of the situation or ""context awareness"" as it is often called. For over fifty years the field of artificial intelligence has contributed many ideas (expert systems, planning, and natural language understanding - to name a few). The ideas of agent based computing and service based architectures are making contributions in this regard. The field of CSCW (computer supported collaborative work) and related research are contributing to the fourth C as it tries to make the world small by enabling people worldwide to work together - albeit with the great inconvenience of dealing with myriad disparate tools, technologies and standards. It is not difficult to speculate how the world of tomorrow will be as we make steady progress on the 4Cs and the resulting advances in pervasive computing. A few are listed below: knowledge workers - a universal knowledge based assistant that helps you to work seamlessly in your local space or shared space exploiting the ambient computing and connectivity; intelligent transportation - a car that avoids accidents, repairs itself and adapts itself to the geographic location and services that are accessible; pervasive healthcare - physicians who can diagnose and treat (reprogramming a device!) patients anywhere and anytime; context-aware appliances - washing machines that know the requirements of clothes that are about to be washed; and enterprises - routine formation of collaborative enterprises worldwide. These are but a few of the exciting things that await us as we come to terms with pervasive computing. However, we need to be cognizant about the many challenges such as loss of privacy and freedoms that are cherished by the societies"
"A visual, open-ended approach to prototyping ubiquitous computing applications",2010 8th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops),2010,"By nature, ubiquitous computing applications are intimately intertwined with users' everyday life. This situation is challenging because it requires to make the development of applications accessible to end-users. Furthermore, ubiquitous computing consists of a variety of areas, including home automation and assisted living, raising a need for an open-ended approach. We present Pantagruel, a visual programming language that is end-user oriented. Our approach is open-ended in that Pantagruel integrates a language to describe a ubiquitous computing environment. Such description takes the form of a taxonomy, defining the entities relevant to a given ubiquitous computing area. This description serves as a parameter to a sensor-controller-actuator development paradigm. The orchestration of area-specific entities is supported by high-level constructs, customized with respect to taxonomical information. We have implemented a visual environment to prototyping ubiquitous computing applications. Furthermore, we have developed a compiler for Pantagruel that targets a domain-specific middleware. Our environment leverages a 2D Tenderer to enable the simulation and of applications. We successfully simulated a range of applications in various ubiquitous computing areas, such as home automation, assisted living and building management."

PCA: A Reference Architecture for Pervasive Computing,2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"With the advanced computing concept of people-oriented and ubiquitous, pervasive computing has become a hot field of computer studies. The rapid development of embedded technology, wireless network technology, mobile computing technology turn pervasive computing theoretical research into practical possibility. To achieve genuine universal computing environment, it is also currently facing many challenges, one of which is its architecture study. View from the current universal calculating developments, a number of pervasive computing models for different specialize areas have been put forward, but also a generic module contains security mechanism for study is absent. According to the current situation and trend of pervasive computing, the service of pervasive environment is categorized into two parts.

The IRBAC 2000 model accomplish flexibly interoperation by dynamic inter-domain role mapping, but how to manage the associations is not discussed, which may cause security problems. Algorithms to detect these security issues are proposed, and the experimental results show that our algorithms can improve the security of the model, so the algorithms can be applied as a security checking mechanism during role mapping in pervasive computing environments."
Make IT matter: The opportunities and responsibilities of pervasive computing research,2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications,2009,"Summary form only given. Many technologists have been wooed by the vision of pervasive or ubiquitous computing. We must recall that much of the initial visions of this field urged a human-centric view of the challenges and opportunities. Much of the initial efforts in our field have addressed important technical challenges, but for the overall health and longevity of pervasive computing, we need to think beyond our own relatively small communities. In this talk, we try to show how our field must turn outward and think beyond the formulation of problems that we alone understand. We show some examples that use health, education and the home as case studies."
Discussion on Pervasive Computing Paradigm,TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference,2005,"Pervasive/ubiquitous computing is considered as the next generation of computing and IT technology (Amor, 2001; Saha et al., 2003).

These devices have become almost indispensable in our modern society. In spite of the proliferation of these devices, the design is done by device manufactures with little interaction or input from the service providers. This paper is intended to provide a brief glimpse into the design thought process from the perspective of a service provider. A series of scenarios will be discussed that can be used to generate user requirements for a universal access device. The traditional design approach is then discussed and the perspective of the service provider is presented."

"Context Awareness, the Spirit of Pervasive Computing",2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"Summary form only given. The main ideas of pervasive/ubiquitous computing include 1) the fusion of cyberspace and physical space, 2) the distraction-free computing. Context awareness is the effort for computer systems to sense and leverage the rich context information in the dual space. It has been recognized as a promising approach to reach the goal of invisibility, which can provide attentive service for user. As a basic service in the computing environment, context-aware service is with four basic functions of collecting, storing, reasoning and querying. The reasoning and inosculating module are for formal reasoning module; the context base module provides the function of storing data and querying; the querying and subscribing module gives the non-processing interface for upper application to request context service; the raw data acquiring module acquires the raw data from the sensors and profile files. Not only can the computing framework provide context common service, but it has favorable expansibility and adaptability. And, location-aware computing is a representative research area of context-aware computing. For which we proposed 1) a multi-object-tracking, highly-precise indoor positioning system, Cicada, to acquire the objects' location in smart space, 2) an expeditious and active location-aware service model, which not only to provide rapid location-related query service to applications, but also to offer the active spatial event service. As a showcase, based on the framework of context-aware service, the smart camera man module which is one part of the smart classroom project was ameliorated and satisfying result is retrieved. Smart camera man module implements the function that switching to the most convenient camera view in terms of the shift of the vision focus of smart classroom, which embodies the distraction-free characteristic of smart space apparently"
A User-centric Applications Sharing Model on Pervasive Computing,2007 2nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2007,"Pervasive computing is booming research field, in which innovative techniques and applications are continuously forming to provide users with high quality ambient and personalized services. Applications available for end-users have become increasingly abundant, distributed and heterogeneous in pervasive computing environment. How to share and utilize these applications is a significant research problem in pervasive computing environment. This paper puts forward a User-centric Applications Sharing Model (U-ASM). The U-ASM mainly focuses on abstracting the applications from service providers and end-users, and then utilizes virtualization technology to encapsulate applications and uses ontology organize distributed applications as a logic unit with semantic relationships so that it can provide better quality of service for end-users. The research result has been applied in R&amp;D Infrastructure and Facility Development of Ministry of Science and Technology and has great flexibility and extensibility."
A User-centric Task Computing Architecture for Pervasive Computing,2008 Third International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2008,"Recent advances in pervasive computing and service-oriented computing have led to a desire to better support user-oriented tasks. Task computing is a new paradigm that tries to provide computational support for humans in terms of their tasks that the human is involved in, which has become a driving force in realizing the vision of pervasive computing. One of the key challenges of task computing paradigm is how to build the appropriate infrastructure in filling the gap between the tasks and the services. To solve the problem, this paper puts forward a user-centric task computing architecture for heterogeneous and dynamic pervasive computing environments which called U-TCA. The U-TCA focuses on sensing and abstracting user's requirement based task model on the one hand, and using middleware to mask the heterogeneity of computing environment on the other hand. The key technologies of the U-TCA are also discussed in detail, including the techniques of task acquisition, task modeling and task mapping."
A tool suite to prototype pervasive computing applications,2010 8th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops),2010,"Despite much progress, developing a pervasive computing application remains a challenge because of a lack of conceptual frameworks and supporting tools. This challenge involves coping with heterogeneous entities, overcoming the intricacies of distributed systems technologies, working out an architecture for the application, encoding it in a program, writing specific code to test the application, and finally deploying it. We present DiaSuite, a tool suite covering the development lifecycle of a pervasive computing system. This tool suite comprises a domain-specific design language, a compiler for this language, which produces a Java programming framework, an editor to define simulation scenarios, and a 2D-renderer to simulate pervasive computing applications. We have validated our tool suite on a variety of comprehensive applications in areas including telecommunications, building automation, and health-care."

Privacy Protection in Ubiquitous Computing,"2010 First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications",2010,"Even though it is hard to define privacy in ubiquitous computing formally, study of privacy protection is now a spotlight of research to accelerate the emergency of ubiquitous computing age. In this paper, IDs assigned by the authority of end user are picked out from sensitive information such as location, time, likings. Service procedure assert, unless under juristic directive, other ID should be used instead. It is ideal to let end users of ubiquitous computing environment decide the level of their privacies required by services, so standardizing schema which depicts services and data requests is the base for end users offer information needed to get expected services with reducing the possibility of exposing who they are. Besides of any progress in preserving sensitive information, clarifying and using potential sensitive information separately from privacy information will do advantage to make services privacy preserving services."
Integration of spoken dialogue system and ubiquitous computing,2019 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops),2019,"With the progress of ubiquitous computing, computers/machines can understand various human contexts via various sensors. A wearable device is possible to estimate calories burned, fatigue degree, even QoL (Quality of Life) by analyzing the heart rate, steps, sleep quality, etc. Simultaneously, the significant progress of deep learning brought the drastic performance improvement in not only image recognition, but also speech processing and natural language. Nowadays, it will become a reality that the humanoid robot instantaneously recognizes what is shown in the camera image and speaks the human-like sentences with human-like voice in multiple languages. Therefore, a collaboration between human and machines have already started. In a call center, AI chatbot has already worked to handle the typical Inquiries on behalf of human operators. A smartwatch and activity trackers keep monitoring owner's physical states and sometimes make an intervention for improving the owner's health. We are also developing the digital signage that persuades the passing person to change his/her behavior to a better way. However, there is still a distance between actual human-to-human interaction and machine-to-human interaction. That means that there is some context information that the machine side is not yet aware of. For example, while human beings observe a slight change of facial expression and body gestures, they change their way of talking and tone, but the machine can not take such information (emotion, agreement, etc.) into consideration when it generates a dialogue. In my keynote, I would like to widely introduce the leading-edge research on context recognition in the research area of ubiquitous computing. Then, I explain the requirements on how next - generation dialogue system should be. In the next-generation dialogue system, it is natural to change the content of conversation and the state of utterance according to the recognized context, for example, the conversation content will change according to the number of steps and stress situation during dialogue. Finally, we discuss technical issues required for integrating spoken dialogue system with ubiquitous computing."
Chaining the secret: Lightweight authentication for security in pervasive computing,2016 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops),2016,"With the proliferation of pervasive computing which enables global connectivity of surrounding objects, the importance of security and its methodology is getting more recognized recently. However, since networking devices composing the pervasive computing are usually resource-constrained compared to traditional devices, there are many difficulties in deploying complex security functionality on them. Even if they have succeeded to provide security protocol, use of heavy authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate-based credential type often becomes another burden. Meanwhile, the most popular and lightweight authentication type is Pre-shared Key (PSK), however, it can be easily exposed by attackers. To overcome this limitation, we present a pre-shared key chaining system which utilizes lightweight PSK and offers moving defense against key attacks with a small overhead. The system generates a chain of arbitrary PSKs without any secret exchanges and provides a new PSK from the chain at each secure session. This work enables constrained devices to communicate in a secure way without high risks of getting compromised, lightweight all the same."

A service model based on recommendation trust in pervasive computing environment,5th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2010,"According to the characteristics of pervasive computing, a suitable service model based on recommendation trust for pervasive computing is presented in this paper. In this model, the concept of recommendation credibility, credibility of service content and indirect credibility are introduced to overcome the problem of pervasive computing in the choice of service provider blindly. Recommendation credibility can prevent the cheating behavior of collusive recommendation. Credibility of service content can evaluate service providers more objective and prevent the cheating behavior of service providers. Indirect credibility can evaluate the recommendation side more comprehensive because it is decided by recommendation credibility and recommendation similarity. The proposed model has the advantage of fitting for dynamic trust characteristics of pervasive computing, preventing the failure behavior of single point and choosing more suitable service provider for service applicants."
Extensions to Jini Service Architecture for Pervasive Computing,2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"Web service architectures are being increasingly used as platforms for distributed applications. Mobile devices are already used everywhere. Both of them are paving the way for the emergence of pervasive computing systems. Many pervasive computing systems have not yet taken mobility and Web service architecture into account due to the lack of an appropriate supporting infrastructure. In this paper we present a new infrastructure for pervasive computing system. The infrastructure builds on both the Jini service architecture and the Web service technology.

A Deep Web Data Integration Model for Pervasive Computing,2008 Third International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2008,"Pervasive computing demands to integrate all kinds of data, but with the rapid development of Web, there are more and more Web databases behind the query forms. It becomes imperative to provide an integrated query engine over Web databases under pervasive computing environments. In this paper, using house domain of Chinese environment as an example, we propose a more effective technique to perform this task. Our frame is called DWDE. Using Domain Ontology the process of Deep Web data integration is simplified, which only includes three modules, that is Query Interfaces Integration, Web Database Selection and Data Merger.

An Implementing Approach to Dynamic Context-Aware Pervasive Computing Application System,2006 First International Symposium on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2006,"Context-aware pervasive computing application system should be flexibly adaptable to dynamic changes of context and application requirements and proactively provide the information satisfied with current context for users. The concept model and developing approach based on preference model presented by (K. Henricksen and J. Indulska, 2004) can satisfy the adaptation of context-aware pervasive computing application in a certain extent. However, this model can't easily describe fuzzy fact. Moreover, codes need be modified when constraints on system behavior have changed. Based on their production, this paper presents one type of rule, expresses fuzzy fact using operator predicate logic and presents a developing approach based on this type of rule. Therefore, the context-aware pervasive computing system developed using this approach need not modify codes when constraints on system behavior have changed. Such system can be more adaptive to dynamic changes and proactively provide information. In addition, requirements of context-aware pervasive computing application system can be expressed more accurately. Finally, experiments and examples prove that the model and approach proposed are feasible"

User Personalized Services Based on Semantic Web for Pervasive Computing,2008 Third International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications,2008,"In pervasive computing environment, more personalized information can be achieved, and better user profile model can be built, thus personalized service can be realized. User profile is the critical aspect in personalized service of digital library. This paper proposes structure and mechanism of user profile in personalized service of digital library. The main problems during its construction are hereinafter introduced in details, which can bring pervasive computing and Web service together tightly. Some technical problems about pervasive-computing-based personalized service are discussed as well include representation, creation and update of user profile. User profile is represented by vector space model (VSM) based ontology. Simple domain ontology of digital library is built first, and then user's interests computed by VSM, in which the item of vector is ontology or concept about user's interests. Features are selected by combining classifying and clustering algorithm, and take support vector machine (SVM) and unsupervised clustering (UC) as example to show the implementation. Using hybrid model, which contains long term model and short term model, compute the interest drifting of user. These two models use different forgetting strategy: short term model use time window and long term model use gradual forgetting algorithm."

Context Selection and Reasoning in Ubiquitous Computing,The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007),2007,"Context reasoning refers to the process of giving high-level context deduction from a set of low-level contexts. It plays an indispensable role in ubiquitous computing. Most existing reasoning methods are proposed with the assumption that the knowledge of low-level context which is relevant to the given high- level context reasoning is available. When this information is lack, the existing methods blindly select some possible low-level contexts for reasoning, so that useless context might be included. These useless contexts have no or little favorable effect for reasoning and increase computation burden as well as repository burden. To deal with this problem, we use information gain-based method for context selection in our work. Only selected contexts are used for reasoning. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is promising."

The approach firstly models user profile as feature vectors. Then pervasive device captures user's implicit feedback based on his/her reading behavior and delivers it to the server. At last, the server infers user interest and updates user profile by adjusting the weights of features to keep track of the dynamic change of user interest. The experiment suggests that the way of implicit feedback in the approach is effective and the precision of the information given to users is encouraging."

The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) can be composed of the distributed sensing networks for the high sensitivity. The cross-sensitivity is the intrinsic problem of FBG sensors. We analyzed the influence of the measurand-strain (or temperature) effect on temperature (or strain) in fiber-optic sensors that employ FBGs.

Auditing System Using Rule-Based Reasoning in Ubiquitous Computing,2008 International Conference on Computational Sciences and Its Applications,2008,"We can use information and software of various forms without being restricted for place and time if ubiquitous computing age comes. However, its dysfunction is causing security problems such as outflow of personal information, hacking, diffusion of virus. Specially, dissemination of software that has malicious purpose in ubiquitous computing environment causes serious damage. We have studied about malicious code detection and software vulnerability detection tool to prevent this. But, existent detection tools are not suited to general software, because they are limitative in specification area. In addition, they can not detect a newly appeared malicious code. We must update pattern of new malicious code, because they use a simple pattern matching technique. In this paper, we propose rule-based auditing system that analyzes structure of target code to solve these problems, define this as rule, and detect malicious codes and software vulnerabilities. Proposed auditing system can construct secure ubiquitous computing environment, because it will be used by a common software audit system that reason about source codes security."

And a typical conference scenario in ubiquitous computing is taken as an example to demonstrate the feasibility and effective of the semantic location-aware model."
An Access Control Model for Ubiquitous Computing Application,"2005 2nd Asia Pacific Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems",2005,"Traditional computer system depends on access policy and user's identities to grant or deny their access to resources. The basic assumption in this system is the entities had been known. It is unsuitable to use identity-based access control in ubiquitous computing environment where entities are not foreknown to each other. In this paper, we present a trust based access control model to secure ubiquitous computing application. The resource-constrained trust negotiation is addressed to establish initial trust for authenticating strangers. By the initial trust, each user is arranged a role subset, and context information dynamic decides which role is active"
Design and implementation of semantic translation engine in ubiquitous computing environment,2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT),2010,"In this paper, we design and implement semantic translation engine to provide continuous among several devices in ubiquitous computing environment. We use many kinds of devices and services according to the location, so it is difficult to provide seamless services among the devices. The proposed engine performs transform of protocols, frame rates, bit rates, and so on. Using our scheme, users can be provided a lot of services continuously among devices in ubiquitous computing environment."
A context policy management framework for ubiquitous computing,2010 The 2nd International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering (ICCAE),2010,"In order to solve the contradiction between information sharing and security privacy in the ubiquitous computing environment, a novel context policy management framework based on ontology is presented. The semantic specification of policy and dynamic policy implementation are described. And the usefulness and flexibility of our proposed framework are demonstrated by a typical ubiquitous computing scenario."
A Mobile Service Language Based on Mobile Agent for Ubiquitous Computing,2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering,2008,This paper provided MML (mobile agent based mobile service language) for ubiquitous computing. The aim of MML is to provide a kind of friendly and seamless mobile service language. It also states the semantics using formal method. Also MML brings forward the context awareness mechanism formobile service in ubiquitous computing.
Using Semantic Web technologies for ubiquitous computing,2008 First IEEE International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing,2008,"Because of the limited methods available for us to communicate through the Web, the way that how we interact with computers to access information over the Web presents one of the biggest barriers for various application. This will require new ways of handling, searching and presenting information. Ubiquitous computing technologies are believed to be the third wave in computing by building a global computing environment where seamless and invisible access to computing resources. The Semantic Web is specially a Web of machine readable information whose meaning is well defined by standards so that both people and computers can understand. This paper has present a attempt to apply semantic Web technologies to ubiquitous computing, It takes family ontology as an example to show how semantic reasoning system (SRS) can make the system automatic by improving the interoperability between systems, applications, and information, It uses OWL for defining a domain family ontology, then set up rules in JESS engine, finally run reasoning by Racer."
Dynamic federation of partitioned applications in ubiquitous computing environments,"Second IEEE Annual Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, 2004. Proceedings of the",2004,"A framework for the dynamic aggregation of ubiquitous computers is presented. The framework aggregates applications from more than one mobile component that can migrate from computer to computer during the execution of applications. Using location-tracking systems, the framework can spatially bind partitioned applications to users and other things and dynamically allocate and migrate a federation of partitioned applications on multiple computers according to the capabilities and locations of the computers and the positions of users. The framework also provides inter-component communications and component relocation semantics so that an application made up components can adapt its structure and functionality to changes in resource availability and the physical environment. A prototype implementation of the framework built on a Java-based mobile agent system and its applications are described."
