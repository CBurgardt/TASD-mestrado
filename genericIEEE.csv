Besides, we also take into account the development requirements of next generation context-aware application. We study the context modeling approaches of some famous existing projects and find that few mode;Context modeling;Ubiquitous computing;Context awareness;Pervasive computing;Middleware;Optical sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Space technology;Application software;Context-aware services;context model;context aware;middleware;ubiquitous computing"
