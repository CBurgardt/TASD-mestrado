abstract = "The current age of increased people mobility calls for a better understanding of how people move: how many places does an individual commonly visit, what are the semantics of these places, and how do people get from one place to another. We show that the number of places visited by each person (Points of Interest – PoIs) is regulated by some properties that are statistically similar among individuals. Subsequently, we present a PoIs classification in terms of their relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the PoIs relevance, we also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter, existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the semantic of PoIs. This is useful for deriving statistics on people’s habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of PoIs distribution and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the nature of the dataset in use. We illustrate that our approach is able to effectively extract a rich set of features describing human mobility and we argue that this can be seminal to novel mobility research."

In this paper, we tackle intrusion detection problems in Ubicomp- ubiquitous environment from different relevant perspectives. The new intrusion detection approach proposed is based on a dual protection mechanism for preventing inside and outside intrusion of a ubiquitous network. The approach is validated using a set simulations allowing to demonstrate the effectiveness, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system in detecting intrusive activities."

Nowadays, the heterogeneity of interconnected things and communication technologies creates several small worlds composed of a single object and a smartphone. For each object, the user needs to download a specific application, search and connect the device. The result is a waste of valuable resources: several objects are able to communicate with the smartphone, but they cannot directly interact among them. In this paper, we propose a model that can be used to define a set of standard interfaces suitable for every smart object. Devices that adhere to the same model can be easily controlled and placed in relation among them, creating multi-object behaviors for a smart space. The smartphone is still a control center, but with a single application it is possible to control and personalize spaces in a holistic way, instead of using the traditional one-to-one approach. Moreover, personalization should be portable: it is desirable that a behavior works in as many smart spaces as possible, at least in a similar way as it does in the environment in which it was configured, freeing the user from the tedious task of adapting it manually every time s/he goes to another space. A portable personalization extends the bring your own device paradigm to a new “bring your own space” paradigm. The model is inspired in the object-oriented programming, reinterpreting features such as inheritance and polymorphism to the real world, so it is possible to provide a software system able to adapt existing behaviors to new spaces. The use of the model is exemplified in the paper with two examples of smart spaces."

Detecting such events may help alerting the population and the local authorities on upcoming augmentations in the UV irradiation.

The way in which this information is presented, and especially when it is presented, may make it difficult for the intensivists within intense healthcare units to understand a patient's state in a timely fashion. Should there be a need to cross various types of clinical data from various sources, the situation worsens considerably. To support the health professional's decision-making process, the Pervasive Business Intelligence (PBI) Systems are a forthcoming field. Based on this principle, the current study approaches the way to present information about the patients, after they are received in a BI system, making them available at any place and at any time for the intensivists that may need it for the decision-making. The patient's history will, therefore, be available, allowing examination of the vital signs data, what medicine that they might need, health checks performed, among others. Then, it is of vital importance, to make these conclusions available to the health professionals every time they might need, so as to aid them in the decision-making. This study aims to make a stance by approaching the theme of PBI in Critical Healthcare. The main objective is to understand the underlying concepts and the assets of BI solutions with Pervasive characteristics. Perhaps consider it a sort of guide or a path to follow for those who wish to insert Pervasive into Business Intelligence in Healthcare area."

A variety of state-of-the-art computing devices that are compatible with each other have been produced. These devices have the ability to interact with people. This is also known as pervasive computing. Particularly, as smartphones have recently become one of the most popular devices worldwide, various convenient applications are being released. Smartphones available today not only provide the ordinary internal processes such as dialing or receiving phone calls, sending text messages, and doing mobile banking, but also increasingly control various other devices that are part of our daily lives. In effect, this means that through smartphone applications, we can remotely control a variety of external devices such as televisions, projectors for presentations, computers, and even cars. The research in this paper is based on the evolving technological possibilities of using smartphone applications to control external devices. This paper presents the design and implementation of a remote lock system using wireless communication on a smartphone. In this context, remote lock system refers to a lock system that can be controlled remotely by a dedicated Android application. Every smartphone is equipped with Bluetooth which makes this technology possible. The application proposed in this paper uses the existing Bluetooth function on Android smartphones to open and manage locks. The users’ lock information can be stored and managed in real time in the database via a server that is built and managed by a server manager. Even if users forget the password of the lock, our proposed lock system can guide them to retrieve it easily, and a user manual is included to help users navigate the system. This system also provides a variety of management functions such as adding, deleting, modifying, and purchasing the user’s own locks."

However, this expansion results a data and information overflow making the handling of the access to the exact needed information more and more complex. This fact explains the need for a contextual access to the information and more generally to the knowledge set in the factory. Based on some fundamentals derived from ubiquitous computing paradigm, this paper proposes an approach to handle contextual access to the manufacturing knowledge."

In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation."

They provide new sophisticated cameras and new visual search interfaces and facilities that can drastically improve their presence and role in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures, such as healthcare monitoring and emergency systems, or remote access control facilities and smart authentication services. This new scenario calls for strong secure and resilient visual query mechanisms for these devices. In this work we propose an innovative secure visual search system, which is well-suited for ubiquitous computing scenarios empowered by modern smart personal devices. More precisely, we show how to insert, at the visual data acquisition time, a watermark inside the already compressed descriptor characterizing an MPEG-CDVS data stream used in visual queries, to make it possible to decode the watermark on the server side in order to improve the robustness against image-based identity spoofing. Such a security enforcement solution may be practical in several real-life applications involving visual queries performed from personal trusted devices, and it is particularly suitable in all those application domains that require performing visual queries with a high degree of security. It has been extensively tested and achieved satisfactory results: the presence of such a watermark does not affect the image matching performance and functionality."

Its applications are everywhere, supporting users in everyday activities in a transparent way with little or no need for attention. To ensure the adoption of these applications, it is essential to assess the quality of the interaction with its users. To do that, measurements can be applied to obtain data about quality characteristics in a software product. In a previous study about quality characteristics and software measures for ubiquitous computing, we have identified a gap in the literature regarding software measures for evaluating essential quality characteristics in ubiquitous systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a suite of well-defined software measures (twenty-four in total), called AQUArIUM, to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) in ubiquitous applications for mobile devices. These measures address five quality characteristics of ubiquitous computing: Context-awareness, Mobility, Attention, Calmness and Transparency. The proposed suite was validated theoretically and empirically. The results showed not only that the suite is feasible, but also that it indicates specific problems of HCI quality, which are helpful in improving the evaluated ubiquitous mobile application."

Furthermore, traffic infrastructure is realized using global and local computing devices. Communication initiated by the car itself (e.g., to an emergency hotline) will be obligatory in some countries soon. And finally, by using a smart phone the driver brings an additional powerful computing device and sensor set to the vehicle. However, all these automotive sensors and computing devices are used just for fixed (and in most cases single) purposes. Data exchange between vehicles or vehicles and infrastructure is rarely done. And dynamic changes like compensating for a broken sensor with available other data, using old sensor equipment for new functions, or improving old driver assistance systems with new sensors is not possible, either. The objective of the collaborative research project Smart Adaptive Data Aggregation (SADA) is to develop technologies that enable linking data from distributed mobile on-board sensors (on vehicles) with data from previously unknown stationary (e.g., infrastructure) or mobile sensors (e.g., other vehicles, smart devices). One focus of the project is the dynamic and fully-automated switching between different sensors or sensor configurations, including the adaptation of data fusion processes. Technically, one important component for some of the SADA use cases is a central backend system that (1) collects sensor data of the vehicles and/or the infrastructure, (2) fuses these data, and (3) carries out machine learning (ML) based analysis of the data to generate new information for the drivers (sometimes refered to by the term “virtual sensors”). The article gives a short overview of the SADA project and describes in more detail the concept of the backend system architec- ture, the user interface, and the methods and processes needed for a demonstration use-case."

It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain–computer interfacing, cyber–physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing."

abstract = "With the recent surge in the use of ubiquitous computing devices, users are carrying their own ubiquitous decision support systems (UDSS) and making important decisions using them. UDSS enables decision makers to access mobile networks to acquire information at anytime, anywhere. However, there have been few studies investigating why UDSS users intend to use the systems continuously, as there would be a large number of elements to take into consideration. The specific factors of the UDSS that this study focuses on include the connectivity and context-awareness function, which were not considered in previous research on the adoption of UDSS. Accordingly, this study empirically explores this research question by using the scanphone-based ubiquitous delivery system (UDS), which many delivery service providers have been adopting recently as a form of the ubiquitous decision support system (UDSS). The results reveal that connectivity, context-awareness function, and perceived values play meaningful roles in the UDSS. Based on these results, this study suggests implications and directions for future research to enable the planning and realization of the future UDSS."

In the UDPF, applications are divided into two independent layers: the front-end and back-end.

The proposed approach stands out by the design of a repository that supports three database models and by the compositional processing strategy based on rules. In our proposal, the applications can combine data stored on different bases in a single rule, which could enhance the identification of contextual situations. For the evaluation we designed and implemented some case studies on information security area, exploring the hybrid repository composed of relational, non-relational, and triple storage models. Our results demonstrate that was possible to identify richer situations with the data composition across more than one model and there are situations that can only be found through this composition."

In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing & access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach."

A smart-space SS typically consists of many rooms, with temperature and humidity environment attributes, devices, and software components that communicate with each other to satisfy certain test purposes that need to be checked over various realistic exterior environment weather conditions.
Objective
We present a novel energy-aware approach for the validation of smart-spaces while minimizing the energy consumption encountered during testing.
Method
A framework for deriving minimal (energy) cost tests is provided. It includes SS, a controlled environment Env that depicts the exterior conditions, and a Tester that can control SS and Env, derive and runs tests, and observe relevant SS attributes in order to release a success verdict whenever a test purpose is met. A simulator is proposed for deriving tests by appropriately exploring part of the SS behavior employing several cost functions for computing the estimated cost and duration of test events.
Results
The framework is deployed in a real SS environment which is used to assess the actual energy consumption of derived tests in practice. Experiments show that the actual power consumption of the derived tests is close to the ones estimated by the simulator. A case study that assesses the gains in using energy aware tests in comparison to non energy-aware alternatives is also provided.
Conclusions
The obtained results highlight the importance of considering power consumption in the development and testing of smart-spaces."

HAR relies on the machine learning models trained using sufficient activity data. However, when the labels from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) are missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help recognize the activities of this position? This problem can be divided into two steps. Firstly, when there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. Secondly, with the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains in order to recognize the activities on the target domain. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a Stratified Transfer Learning (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and activity transfer. STL is based on our proposed Stratified distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: 1) Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS), which can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; and 2) Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT), which is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL."

This is a challenging problem because of the stream nature of data, the complexity and changing nature of contexts. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for the detection of co-location contexts from Bluetooth signals. By using an Indian buffet process as the prior distribution, the model can discover the number of contexts automatically. We introduce a novel fixed-lag particle filter that processes data incrementally. This sampling scheme is especially suitable for pervasive computing as the computational requirements remain constant in spite of growing data. We examine our model on a synthetic dataset and two real world datasets. To verify the discovered contexts, we compare them to the communities detected by the Louvain method, showing a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. Fixed-lag particle filter is compared with Gibbs sampling in terms of the normalized factorization error that shows a close performance between the two inference methods. As fixed-lag particle filter processes a small chunk of data when it comes and does not need to be restarted, its execution time is significantly shorter than that of Gibbs sampling."

The technique monitors user behaviour through identifying certain types of activity without the need for detailed tracking of user behaviour, thus minimising intrusion on the user’s normal activities. The technique was evaluated using a simulated environment to assess its reliability. Simulation results show that the technique can be applied in various situations such as strict and relaxed security settings by applying different security policies. They also show that the technique is particularly effective where the environment has a mixture of high and low security resources in which case reliability could exceed 99%."

Ubiquitous computing provides any services anywhere and anytime through networks conveniently to improve the quality of life of users. Ubiquitous computing is constructed via a variety of invisible sensors, networks, and computing environments. For multi-purpose sensors, deployment of the topology and topology lifetime are very important depending on wired or wireless sensors. Uneven energy consumption due to integrated routing sensors according to topology deployment types is a factor that degrades the quality of service (QoS) about user convenience services and lifetime of total topology. As a result, a number of studies on maximization of topology lifetime have been conducted. However, previous studies focused on deployment environments and limited sensors so that they cannot be deployed to real sites. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive power management scheme (APMS) that manages sensor power adaptively according to deployment environments to maximize topology lifetime. The APMS maximizes topology lifetime by changing routing paths according to lifetime log to manage sensor power. Furthermore, active responses for optimum topology can be achieved by deploying sensors via simulation prior to sensors deployed to the real environments by users."

Also, they can replace, in some scenarios, the conventional authentication methods. In this paper, we propose a practical context-aware authentication system which is cost-effective and easy to implement. The environmental information is only sent when the user makes an authentication request which renders our system more practical and lightweight. However, the authentication request goes through different steps in order to make a decision regarding the access."

In this paper we present a case study for a SME (Small Medium Enterprise) with 20 employees distributed in 5 working teams that develop their daily work in a two-floors building with a WiFi-based passive localization system. An initial analysis of the 802.11 radio signals collected by the system determines, with a high accuracy rate, which mobile devices among the thousands of recorded MAC addresses belong to employees. Additionally, making use of the localization engine, we are able to identify working patterns for the different working teams that, consequently, open the way for implementing efficient anomaly detection techniques."

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper."

This paper undertakes a critical review of the literature that offers and discusses definitions of this “third wave”. Not surprisingly in an area of innovation, definitions are evolving, overlapping and inconsistent. This paper analyses and consolidates the literature in order to identify the key aspects of this new phenomenon. We have coined the term “eObjects”1 for the central element of the “third wave”. The paper presents a framework for research into the technologies and their implications, distinguishing core from common attributes, and identifying categories of inter-device interaction. A subsequent paper will apply the research framework to legal research, with the intention of understanding areas in which litigation can be anticipated, and uncovering areas where the law may not adequately deal with emergent social and business practices."

We propose a self-adaptive pervasive fall detection approach that is robust to the heterogeneity of real life situations. Using the data of four publicly available datasets, we show that our system is not only robust regarding the different dimensions of heterogeneity, but also adapts autonomously to spontaneous changes in the sensor’s position at runtime. In this paper, we extend our self-adaptive fall detection system with (i) additional algorithms for fall detection, (ii) an approach for cross-positional sensor fusion, (iii) a fall detection approach that relies on outlier detection, and (iv) a smart fall alert.

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution."

Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) seeks to overcome the issues by following the idea of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The CaaS delivery model attempts to separate context service consumers from context service providers. However, CaaS shifts the complexities of context service provisioning and management from consumers toward providers. Considering the merits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in coping with the complexities of problems in different domains, we leverage MDD in the CaaS domain and propose the CaaSSET framework to ease the development of context services. A prerequisite for realizing this aim is to specify the CaaS domain as a meta-model. Our CaaSSET framework consists of a CaaS reference model, a context service meta-model, a graphical modeling tool, a code generation tool, and a context service management tool. Using CaaSSET, the context services are modeled in a graphical environment and transformed into executable context web services (semi-) automatically. To evaluate the applicability of the CaaSSET framework, we have modeled and developed a tourism context service as a case study. We have also compared the framework with the related work based on 44 evaluation criteria, which we have extracted from 14 context service requirements."

However, this study investigates not only these factors, but also the moderating effect of previous experience. Due to the technological nature of ubiquitous services, previous experience alters the way in which potential users face these services. Findings suggest that previous experience changes the way in which antecedent relates to basic TAM constructs.

In order to collect data for researching the relationship between smartphone data and personality, we developed the Android app TYDR (Track Your Daily Routine) which tracks smart-phone data and utilizes psychometric personality questionnaires. With TYDR, we track a larger variety of smartphone data than similar existing apps, including metadata on notifications, photos taken, and music played back by the user. For the development of TYDR, we introduce a general context data model consisting of four categories that focus on the user’s different types of interactions with the smartphone: physical conditions and activity, device status and usage, core functions usage, and app usage. On top of this, we develop the privacy model PM-MoDaC specifically for apps related to the collection of mobile data, consisting of nine proposed privacy measures. We present the implementation of all of those measures in TYDR. Although the utilization of the user’s personality based on the usage of his or her smartphone is a challenging endeavor, it seems to be a promising approach for various types of context-aware mobile applications."

abstract = "Human beings with smart devices have dramatically facilitated the knowledge acquisition in ubiquitous computing systems. However, the collected contents also severely threat the security and privacy for individuals, as these contents achieve a fine-grained coverage of one’s behaviors and movements. Local differential privacy, as one of the widely accepted properties, enables individuals to contribute to data collection while remaining indistinguishable against adversaries. However, existing solutions and mechanisms fail to capture the contents with relatively low frequency, e.g., the temperature in local regions visited by very few people. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for distinct content estimation under local differential privacy. We propose a hash function and random response based framework for the estimation. The framework allows individuals in the ubiquitous computing system to participate with flexible bandwidth, and properly assigns the given bandwidth to improve estimated results. We prove the optimization problem of assignment in our framework to be NP-complete, and provides an effective heuristic algorithm. Our framework is also proved to guarantee an unbiased estimation for distinct contents, and achieves local differential privacy for users. Meanwhile, we also propose a randomized algorithm designed for more general cases, where the preposed knowledge for the first algorithm is unavailable. Finally, we evaluate both algorithms on real world datasets, and the results reveal that our algorithms outperform existing methods."

abstract = "In ubiquitous computing, end-user composition allows users to combine multiple single-purpose devices into new, interesting constellations. In PalCom – a ubiquitous middleware – this is achieved without the need to write program code. In this paper we present a solution that in the same way allows users to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for such systems without coding. The approach is to focus on presenting functionality in a GUI rather than attaching functionality to manually added components. We see this as an inverted way of working with GUI development. The solution was realized in the form of a graphical editor for a PalCom specific User Interface Description Language. The tool produces platform independent GUI descriptions that can be interpreted on any platform. When compared to another common tool, the presented editor exhibited roughly 10x shorter development times. The learning time for new users was also evaluated with positive outcome, and a scalability evaluation showed that the solution can be used to create professional grade GUIs."

In an ageing world population more citizens are at risk of cognitive impairment, with negative consequences on their ability of independent living, quality of life and sustainability of healthcare systems. Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective.
Methods
A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level.
Results
We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates."

Context-aware applications need to react and adapt to changes in their computing environment, which is in general ubiquitous and inherently distributed. Therefore, the context communication faces the problem of context representations heterogeneity, the limitation of devices capacity and network bandwidth. In order to overcome this challenging issue, a particular management of the context is required either for its collection, update, and exchange. In this paper, we propose an approach to manage the context in ubiquitous environments based on the semantic representation of the context and its update using standard languages such as RDF and RDF(s). Our proposed approach provides the simplicity and flexibility that allow the developer to express the context without the need for a unified context model. The results of the experimentation carried out using a prototype implementation of a middleware supports the proposed approach, are in favour of using our approach in the case of resource-constrained devices and network."

In pervasive computing environment, the combination of ubiquitous overlay networks and the capacity of multihoming can provide the possibility of exploiting plentiful available paths. Thus, we introduce a Pervasive Multipath Architecture (PEMA), in which we use the game theory to investigate the selfish strategic collaboration of multiple heterogeneous overlays when they are allowed to use the massively-multipath transfer. Overlay networks are modeled as “players” in this multipath selection game, and we study the asymmetric case where all overlays have different Round Trip Times (RTT) and different degrees of waste. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE). In addition, we find that overlays differing only in their RTTs still receive proportional throughput shares and utilities at the NE. However, if overlays differ only in their degrees of waste, a more wasteful overlay has a larger utility and a larger throughput (bandwidth) share than a less wasteful overlay. Since maintaining connected paths consumes resource, we further consider a more generalized cost function where an overlay’s total resource consumption includes both transferring data packets and maintaining path connections. In this general game, we find that the overlay is more conservative, which opens smaller number of paths and obtains smaller efficiency loss at the NE than in other simplified games. Our simulations confirm the effectiveness and friendliness of multipath transfer for a range of path numbers and in the presence of multi-overlay traffic."

Pervasive computing applications can be formulated on top of the IoT involving nodes that can interact with their environment and perform various processing tasks. Any task is part of intelligent services executed in nodes or the back end infrastructure for supporting end users’ applications. In this setting, one can identify the need for applying updates in the software/firmware of the autonomous nodes. Updates are extensions or patches significant for the efficient functioning of nodes. Legacy methodologies deal with centralized approaches where complex protocols are adopted to support the distribution of the updates in the entire network. In this paper, we depart from the relevant literature and propose a distributed model where each node is responsible to, independently, initiate and conclude the update process. Nodes monitor a set of metrics related to their load and the performance of the network and through a time-optimized scheme identify the appropriate time to conclude the update process. We report on an infinite horizon optimal stopping model on top of the collected performance data. The aim is to make nodes capable of identifying when their performance and the performance of the network are of high quality to efficiently conclude the update process. We provide specific formulations and the analysis of the problem while extensive simulations and a comparison assessment reveal the advantages of the proposed solution."

Our aim is to have the nodes independently deciding the initiation of the update process by finding the appropriate time to execute it. Every node acts autonomously and monitors the network's performance to find a slot where performance parameters advocate for an efficient and uninterrupted conclusion of the update task. Hence, the proposed model can be adapted to the environment and the status of each node. The final decision is made taking into consideration multiple parameters and it is based on the solution of the widely known Secretary Problem (SP) originated in the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST).

In this paper, we present XWARE, an interoperability framework that allows to integrate discovery and interaction of different middleware platforms. The flexible design allows to configure and extend the interoperability framework in order to add new platforms and tailor it for the use in different domains. Furthermore, XWARE instances can communicate with each other enabling interoperability in smart environments as well as in smart peer groups.

So far, many of PDs do not provide a means of interaction acting only act as output devices that present information. On the other hand, smartphones have become increasingly popular due to their number of users, inherent properties and power. It has been argued that digital information is required for most meetings, whether formal or informal. With technological improvement and the growing of the ubiquity of both PDs and smartphones, streaming data between devices should be done smoothly in formal or informal meetings. While many possibilities exist for communication between such devices, file sharing in these scenarios is still restricted. These solutions also focus only on new mechanisms for interaction with PDs and ignore PDs’ primary function of displaying information. To solve this problem, we present a novel technique that allows users to transfer different types of files while preserving the security of these files. The technique will be particularly used to transfer files from smartphones to PDs in various kinds of meetings. The system combines both traditional uses of PDs (such as displaying announcements) and interactive ways of giving real-time presentations by uploading files, marking important parts of pages and writing notes. The findings imply that a majority of users are ready to use the system. Furthermore, the systems's performance evaluation results are very encouraging and reveal that the deployed tool is an effective method that can be a reasonable alternative to using projectors."

abstract = "Pervasive and sensor-driven systems are by nature open and extensible, both in terms of input and tasks they are required to perform. Data streams coming from sensors are inherently noisy, imprecise and inaccurate, with differing sampling rates and complex correlations with each other. These characteristics pose a significant challenge for traditional approaches to storing, representing, exchanging, manipulating and programming with sensor data. Semantic Web technologies provide a uniform framework for capturing these properties. Offering powerful representation facilities and reasoning techniques, these technologies are rapidly gaining attention towards facing a range of issues such as data and knowledge modelling, querying, reasoning, service discovery, privacy and provenance. This article reviews the application of the Semantic Web to pervasive and sensor-driven systems with a focus on information modelling and reasoning along with streaming data and uncertainty handling. The strengths and weaknesses of current and projected approaches are analysed and a roadmap is derived for using the Semantic Web as a platform, on which open, standard-based, pervasive, adaptive and sensor-driven systems can be deployed."

We consider the analysis of media multiplicities from the point of view of both user experience and creative production. We offer three primary axes through which a categorisation of multiplicitous media forms can be framed: substrate versus object; composed versus self-organised, and homogeneous versus heterogeneous. We also analyse how the number of elements in the multiplicities (from tens to tens of thousands and beyond) affects the qualities of the experience."

Obfuscation techniques are desirable in reducing the impact of disclosing confidential information but with a significant loss of utility of information content. Thus, accesses to confidential data by mobile users need to be controlled so as to minimize the disclosure risks. To achieve these requirements, we propose a novel location-dependent disclosure risk based decision support framework for persistent authentication and data access management. We have derived the location dependent identity based disclosure risks at record level and file level by using the search theory and entropy. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed model using multi-level security model and fuzzy sets. We have further proved that our proposed technique can significantly reduce the impact of common privacy attacks by performing a comprehensive security analysis. In conclusion, this research presents a novel location-dependent disclosure risk-based decision support framework persistent authentication and a pragmatic data access management approach for highly privacy-sensitive pervasive computing applications."

Focusing on the recently introduced concept of pervasive ecosystems, the proposed model revolves around (i) the notion of a distributed and dynamic space of “live semantic annotations” (wrapping data, knowledge, and the relevant facts about activities of humans, devices, and services) upon which autonomous agents coordinate and (ii) a small set of chemical-resembling coordination rules that enforce mechanisms of diffusion, aggregation, decay, and bonding between such annotations."

In this article, we reflect on the ways in which ideas of animal-centric development may impact the development of technology for animals in practice. We start by looking at the process of development for and with animals, and propose a development model facilitating the principles of Agility, Welfare of Animals, and eXperts’ involvement (AWAX) within the development lifecycle. While promoting the animal-centric approach, it is important to acknowledge that an animal usually uses technology through humans and in a particular environment. We further extend the AWAX model to include considerations of the human in the loop and the environment, and discuss some practical implications of this view, including aspects such as security and privacy."

Recent models consider this behavior as a combination of both social and spatial factors. Yet, establishing accurate traces of human groups is difficult: current techniques capture either positions, or contacts, with a limited accuracy. In this paper we introduce a new technique to capture such behaviors. The interest of this approach lies in the unprecedented accuracy at which both positions and orientations of humans, even gathered in a crowd, are captured. The open-source software pipeline we developed to exploit captured data allows extraction of several metrics on movement and social contacts, and permits study of their respective interrelationship. From the mobility to the topological connectivity, this framework offers a layered approach that can be tailored, allowing to compare and reason about models and traces. We demonstrate the accuracy and validity of our approach on social events and calibration runs in which we captured the motions of humans. In particular, we introduce an open-access trace of 50 individuals and compare it against random waypoint models that have the same global characteristics. Our fine-grain analyses, that take into account social interactions between users, show that the random way point model does not provide accurate predictions for socially-induced motion; to model human kinetics, new group- and interaction-based models should be developed. From the computer science point of view, these models are required to fully exploit the power of human-centered mobile computing, crucial for ubiquitous computing, and referred to as Short Range Communication Systems, Mobile Opportunistic Networking, or Mobile Networking in Proximity."

It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies."

Many data protection methods based on this AON data protection concepts are developed aiming to enhance the classical encryption schemes.

ChronicPrediction is an intelligent system for noncommunicable diseases care which determines in real time the impact on risk factors due to actions taken by users. Based on impact information, the system presents on users’ smartphones strategic messages to help in their treatment. ChronicPrediction applies Bayesian Networks (BNs) which use risk factors for mapping the causes of noncommunicable diseases worsening. The support to multiple chronic diseases and the integrated use of multiple BNs based on risk factors are the main contributions of this work and differentiate the proposed system from related work. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first one successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ChronicPrediction to support BNs based on risk factors and the sending of messages to users’ smartphones. The evaluation involved the building of a BN for predicting coronary artery disease made with real world data obtained in a prospective cohort study. The study involved 302 patients from a hospital localized in southern Brazil. The second experiment assessed the ChronicPrediction support to multiple BNs at same time. The test involved the previous BN and another from a thirty part research work to map risk factors of diabetes. The results were encouraging and show potential for implementing ChronicPrediction in real-life situations."

Context-aware software systems can interact with different devices to complete their tasks and act according to the context, regardless of their development and organizational differences. Interoperability is a big challenge in the engineering of such systems.
Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability."

However, it still presents a number of challenges, both for the full implementation of technologies and for the integration with existing information systems. One of the main mismatches evidenced by recent works is how context-awareness, a widely used capability in ubiquitous computing and actual information systems with relational databases may be integrated to allow ubiquitous and traditional systems to query relational data sources without the necessity to modify the schema of the database. This paper presents an integration model relating context and domain information allowing relational data to be retrieved in context without the necessity to change the originally used relational queries. A set of linking rules and algorithms are formalized in a model and this model is implemented in a prototype. The evaluation of the model is performed by applying it in a case study in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. The evaluation of the model by the application of it in a case study in a MOOC platform demonstrated the possibility to use an ontology frequently used in ubiquitous middleware as an extra filtering layer for information systems without the necessity to recreate queries or make a re-engineering in the relational database schema. The results of the queries after the application of the model showed an average decrease of 21% in returned tuples, which was evaluated as a significant reduce in tuple results."

Currently, most sensor-based activity recognition techniques rely on supervised learning algorithms. However, the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities in smart homes is expensive and violates the individual’s privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel hybrid approach that couples collaborative active learning with probabilistic and knowledge-based reasoning. The rationale of our approach is that a generic, and possibly incomplete, knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method exploiting users’ feedback to (i) refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology, and (ii) mine temporal patterns of sensor events that are frequently generated by the execution of specific activities. A Markov Logic Network is used to recognize activities with probabilistic rules that capture both the ontological knowledge and the information obtained by active learning. We experimented our solution with a real-world dataset of activities carried out by several individuals in an interleaved fashion. Experimental results show that our collaborative and personalized active learning solution significantly improves recognition rates, while triggering a small number of feedback requests. Moreover, the overall recognition rates compare favorably with existing supervised and unsupervised activity recognition methods."

abstract = "This article discusses how the elderly experience their ICT usage as the aging citizens of the Finnish information society. Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human–(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the “ICT biographies” of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging ICT users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy ICT users in relation to younger “generations”, for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on ICT and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing ICT practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography?"

It is crucial that the provides have full visibility of their context i.e., the set of available and relevant resources depending on access control rules, client locations user preferences, privacy requirements, terminal characteristics and current state of hosting environments. The applications developed for pervasive computing are very hard, but they are necessary to build ubiquitous computing environment. Few researchers have indeed focused on some of these requirements but there is a practical difference between theory and its achievement. A new model is proposed for pervasive computing. A solution to the existing problems is proposed through this paper. Some of the ways to improve the performance environments through the use of middleware is also proposed in this research work."

Our approach guarantees that when the transaction occurs and the products are dispensed the consumer is physically close to the vending machine. Open innovation, ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive technologies are key aspects taken into consideration to build up a cost affordable solution. The ultimate goal is to minimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for vending operators while enhancing the consumer purchasing experience, driving up the demand for mass adoption of the “Internet of vending machines”."

To this end, this paper investigates the very specific area of clustering or partitioning an object-oriented application running on mobile devices. Graph theory has been used to model an application and a cluster analysis algorithm has been proposed. Details about the implementation are covered, followed by a laboratory application partitioning using the proposed approach. Researchers and software designers willing to investigate software partitioning can consider this practical and easy implementable approach."

To our knowledge, this is the first work to address the privacy issue of the RTB paradigm. We present a formal proof for the security of Pri-RTB under the assumption of the decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH) problem. We analyze and elaborate the superiority of Pri-RTB over other related works. We also developed a prototype for Pri-RTB and conducted several experiments to evaluate its feasibility and efficiency under different parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that Pri-RTB can work highly efficiently in a practical setting (for example, a scenario with approximately 200 advertisers per auction)."

Nevertheless, when two users are at the first interaction, they have no historical data involving their own activities to be analyzed, and then use information (recommender-data) provided by other users (recommenders) who, in the past, have had interactions with one of the involved parties. Although this approach has proven to be effective, it might fail if dishonest recommenders provide unfair recommender-data. Indeed, such unfair data may lead to skewed evaluations, and therefore either increase the trustworthiness of a malicious user or reduce the one of a honest user in a fraudulent way. In this work, we propose an algorithm for identifying false recommender-data. Our attention is explicitly focused on recommender-data rather than recommenders. This because some recommenders could provide recommender-data containing only a limited (but specific) set of altered information. This is used by dishonest recommenders as a tactic to avoid being discovered. The proposed algorithm uses association rules to express a confidence-based measure (reputation rank), which is used as a reliability ranking of the recommender-data. The resulting approach has been compared with other existing ones in this field, resulting more accurate in finding out unfair recommender-data sent by dishonest recommenders."

And one of the most significant discussions in this field is how to adapt the learning rate and convergent path dynamically. This paper proposes a gradient-based algorithm called Adacom, that is based on an adaptive control system and momentum. Critically inheriting the previous studies, a reference model is introduced to generate the update. The method reduces noise and decides on paths with less oscillation, while maintaining the accumulated learning rate. Due to system design properties, the method requires fewer hyper-parameters for tuning. We state the prospect of Adacom as a general optimizer in Autonomous Cloud, and explore the potential of Adacom for pervasive computing by the assumption of transition data. Then we demonstrate the convergence of Adacom theoretically. The evaluations over the simulated transition data prove the feasibility and superiority of Adacom with other gradient-based methods."

We show that the number of places visited by each person (Points of Interest – PoIs) is regulated by some properties that are statistically similar among individuals. Subsequently, we present a PoIs classification in terms of their relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the PoIs relevance, we also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter, existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the semantic of PoIs. This is useful for deriving statistics on people’s habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of PoIs distribution and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the nature of the dataset in use. We illustrate that our approach is able to effectively extract a rich set of features describing human mobility and we argue that this can be seminal to novel mobility research."

Nowadays, the heterogeneity of interconnected things and communication technologies creates several small worlds composed of a single object and a smartphone. For each object, the user needs to download a specific application, search and connect the device. The result is a waste of valuable resources: several objects are able to communicate with the smartphone, but they cannot directly interact among them. In this paper, we propose a model that can be used to define a set of standard interfaces suitable for every smart object. Devices that adhere to the same model can be easily controlled and placed in relation among them, creating multi-object behaviors for a smart space. The smartphone is still a control center, but with a single application it is possible to control and personalize spaces in a holistic way, instead of using the traditional one-to-one approach. Moreover, personalization should be portable: it is desirable that a behavior works in as many smart spaces as possible, at least in a similar way as it does in the environment in which it was configured, freeing the user from the tedious task of adapting it manually every time s/he goes to another space. A portable personalization extends the bring your own device paradigm to a new “bring your own space” paradigm. The model is inspired in the object-oriented programming, reinterpreting features such as inheritance and polymorphism to the real world, so it is possible to provide a software system able to adapt existing behaviors to new spaces. The use of the model is exemplified in the paper with two examples of smart spaces."

The way in which this information is presented, and especially when it is presented, may make it difficult for the intensivists within intense healthcare units to understand a patient's state in a timely fashion. Should there be a need to cross various types of clinical data from various sources, the situation worsens considerably. To support the health professional's decision-making process, the Pervasive Business Intelligence (PBI) Systems are a forthcoming field. Based on this principle, the current study approaches the way to present information about the patients, after they are received in a BI system, making them available at any place and at any time for the intensivists that may need it for the decision-making. The patient's history will, therefore, be available, allowing examination of the vital signs data, what medicine that they might need, health checks performed, among others. Then, it is of vital importance, to make these conclusions available to the health professionals every time they might need, so as to aid them in the decision-making. This study aims to make a stance by approaching the theme of PBI in Critical Healthcare. The main objective is to understand the underlying concepts and the assets of BI solutions with Pervasive characteristics.

This research focuses on proposing a secure model to maintain the secrecy in a cloud environment using intelligent agent. This paper presents an intelligent model to protect user’s valuable personal data. Preserving proprietor’s data and information in cloud is one of the top most challenging missions for cloud provider. Many researches fanatical their valuable time’s to discover some technique, algorithms and protocols to solve secrecy issue and develop a full-fledged cloud computing standard structure as a newest computing to all cloud users. Some researchers came forward with cryptography technique, cyber middle wear technique, noise injection and third party layer technique to preserve privacy about data in cloud. We propose a hybrid authentication technique as an end point lock. It is a composite model coupled with an algorithm for user’s privacy preserving, which is likely to be Hash Diff Anomaly Detection and Prevention (HDAD). This algorithmic protocol acts intelligently as a privacy preserving model and technique to ensure the users data are kept more secretly and develop an endorsed trust on providers. We also explore the highest necessity to maintain the confidentiality of cloud user’s data."

A variety of state-of-the-art computing devices that are compatible with each other have been produced. These devices have the ability to interact with people. This is also known as pervasive computing. Particularly, as smartphones have recently become one of the most popular devices worldwide, various convenient applications are being released. Smartphones available today not only provide the ordinary internal processes such as dialing or receiving phone calls, sending text messages, and doing mobile banking, but also increasingly control various other devices that are part of our daily lives. In effect, this means that through smartphone applications, we can remotely control a variety of external devices such as televisions, projectors for presentations, computers, and even cars. The research in this paper is based on the evolving technological possibilities of using smartphone applications to control external devices. This paper presents the design and implementation of a remote lock system using wireless communication on a smartphone. In this context, remote lock system refers to a lock system that can be controlled remotely by a dedicated Android application. Every smartphone is equipped with Bluetooth which makes this technology possible. The application proposed in this paper uses the existing Bluetooth function on Android smartphones to open and manage locks. The users’ lock information can be stored and managed in real time in the database via a server that is built and managed by a server manager. Even if users forget the password of the lock, our proposed lock system can guide them to retrieve it easily, and a user manual is included to help users navigate the system. This system also provides a variety of management functions such as adding, deleting, modifying, and purchasing the user’s own locks."

However, this expansion results a data and information overflow making the handling of the access to the exact needed information more and more complex. This fact explains the need for a contextual access to the information and more generally to the knowledge set in the factory. Based on some fundamentals derived from ubiquitous computing paradigm, this paper proposes an approach to handle contextual access to the manufacturing knowledge."

In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation."

They provide new sophisticated cameras and new visual search interfaces and facilities that can drastically improve their presence and role in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures, such as healthcare monitoring and emergency systems, or remote access control facilities and smart authentication services. This new scenario calls for strong secure and resilient visual query mechanisms for these devices. In this work we propose an innovative secure visual search system, which is well-suited for ubiquitous computing scenarios empowered by modern smart personal devices. More precisely, we show how to insert, at the visual data acquisition time, a watermark inside the already compressed descriptor characterizing an MPEG-CDVS data stream used in visual queries, to make it possible to decode the watermark on the server side in order to improve the robustness against image-based identity spoofing. Such a security enforcement solution may be practical in several real-life applications involving visual queries performed from personal trusted devices, and it is particularly suitable in all those application domains that require performing visual queries with a high degree of security. It has been extensively tested and achieved satisfactory results: the presence of such a watermark does not affect the image matching performance and functionality."

Its applications are everywhere, supporting users in everyday activities in a transparent way with little or no need for attention. To ensure the adoption of these applications, it is essential to assess the quality of the interaction with its users. To do that, measurements can be applied to obtain data about quality characteristics in a software product. In a previous study about quality characteristics and software measures for ubiquitous computing, we have identified a gap in the literature regarding software measures for evaluating essential quality characteristics in ubiquitous systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a suite of well-defined software measures (twenty-four in total), called AQUArIUM, to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) in ubiquitous applications for mobile devices. These measures address five quality characteristics of ubiquitous computing: Context-awareness, Mobility, Attention, Calmness and Transparency. The proposed suite was validated theoretically and empirically. The results showed not only that the suite is feasible, but also that it indicates specific problems of HCI quality, which are helpful in improving the evaluated ubiquitous mobile application."

Furthermore, traffic infrastructure is realized using global and local computing devices. Communication initiated by the car itself (e.g., to an emergency hotline) will be obligatory in some countries soon. And finally, by using a smart phone the driver brings an additional powerful computing device and sensor set to the vehicle. However, all these automotive sensors and computing devices are used just for fixed (and in most cases single) purposes. Data exchange between vehicles or vehicles and infrastructure is rarely done. And dynamic changes like compensating for a broken sensor with available other data, using old sensor equipment for new functions, or improving old driver assistance systems with new sensors is not possible, either. The objective of the collaborative research project Smart Adaptive Data Aggregation (SADA) is to develop technologies that enable linking data from distributed mobile on-board sensors (on vehicles) with data from previously unknown stationary (e.g., infrastructure) or mobile sensors (e.g., other vehicles, smart devices). One focus of the project is the dynamic and fully-automated switching between different sensors or sensor configurations, including the adaptation of data fusion processes. Technically, one important component for some of the SADA use cases is a central backend system that (1) collects sensor data of the vehicles and/or the infrastructure, (2) fuses these data, and (3) carries out machine learning (ML) based analysis of the data to generate new information for the drivers (sometimes refered to by the term “virtual sensors”). The article gives a short overview of the SADA project and describes in more detail the concept of the backend system architec- ture, the user interface, and the methods and processes needed for a demonstration use-case."

abstract = "As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain–computer interfacing, cyber–physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing."

UDSS enables decision makers to access mobile networks to acquire information at anytime, anywhere. However, there have been few studies investigating why UDSS users intend to use the systems continuously, as there would be a large number of elements to take into consideration. The specific factors of the UDSS that this study focuses on include the connectivity and context-awareness function, which were not considered in previous research on the adoption of UDSS. Accordingly, this study empirically explores this research question by using the scanphone-based ubiquitous delivery system (UDS), which many delivery service providers have been adopting recently as a form of the ubiquitous decision support system (UDSS). The results reveal that connectivity, context-awareness function, and perceived values play meaningful roles in the UDSS. Based on these results, this study suggests implications and directions for future research to enable the planning and realization of the future UDSS."

The proposed approach stands out by the design of a repository that supports three database models and by the compositional processing strategy based on rules. In our proposal, the applications can combine data stored on different bases in a single rule, which could enhance the identification of contextual situations. For the evaluation we designed and implemented some case studies on information security area, exploring the hybrid repository composed of relational, non-relational, and triple storage models. Our results demonstrate that was possible to identify richer situations with the data composition across more than one model and there are situations that can only be found through this composition."

In the residential setting, the enhanced features and services provided by said computing devices constitute what is typically referred to as a “smart home”. However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues. This paper presents XSACd, a cross-domain resource sharing & access control framework for smart environments, combining the well-studied fine-grained access control provided by the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures, through the use of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). Based on standardized technologies, it enables seamless interactions and fine-grained policy-based management of heterogeneous smart devices, including support for communication between distributed networks, via the associated MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT)–based proxies. The framework is implemented in full, and its performance is evaluated on a test bed featuring relatively resource-constrained smart platforms and embedded devices, verifying the feasibility of the proposed approach."

abstract = "Context
A smart-space SS typically consists of many rooms, with temperature and humidity environment attributes, devices, and software components that communicate with each other to satisfy certain test purposes that need to be checked over various realistic exterior environment weather conditions.
Objective
We present a novel energy-aware approach for the validation of smart-spaces while minimizing the energy consumption encountered during testing.
Method
A framework for deriving minimal (energy) cost tests is provided. It includes SS, a controlled environment Env that depicts the exterior conditions, and a Tester that can control SS and Env, derive and runs tests, and observe relevant SS attributes in order to release a success verdict whenever a test purpose is met. A simulator is proposed for deriving tests by appropriately exploring part of the SS behavior employing several cost functions for computing the estimated cost and duration of test events.
Results
The framework is deployed in a real SS environment which is used to assess the actual energy consumption of derived tests in practice. Experiments show that the actual power consumption of the derived tests is close to the ones estimated by the simulator. A case study that assesses the gains in using energy aware tests in comparison to non energy-aware alternatives is also provided.
Conclusions
The obtained results highlight the importance of considering power consumption in the development and testing of smart-spaces."

HAR relies on the machine learning models trained using sufficient activity data. However, when the labels from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) are missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help recognize the activities of this position? This problem can be divided into two steps. Firstly, when there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. Secondly, with the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains in order to recognize the activities on the target domain. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a Stratified Transfer Learning (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and activity transfer. STL is based on our proposed Stratified distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: 1) Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS), which can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; and 2) Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT), which is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL."

This is a challenging problem because of the stream nature of data, the complexity and changing nature of contexts. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for the detection of co-location contexts from Bluetooth signals. By using an Indian buffet process as the prior distribution, the model can discover the number of contexts automatically. We introduce a novel fixed-lag particle filter that processes data incrementally. This sampling scheme is especially suitable for pervasive computing as the computational requirements remain constant in spite of growing data. We examine our model on a synthetic dataset and two real world datasets. To verify the discovered contexts, we compare them to the communities detected by the Louvain method, showing a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. Fixed-lag particle filter is compared with Gibbs sampling in terms of the normalized factorization error that shows a close performance between the two inference methods. As fixed-lag particle filter processes a small chunk of data when it comes and does not need to be restarted, its execution time is significantly shorter than that of Gibbs sampling."

The technique, termed Non-intrusive Identity Assertion System (NIAS), uses knowledge of how the user uses the environment’s services to infer their identity. The technique monitors user behaviour through identifying certain types of activity without the need for detailed tracking of user behaviour, thus minimising intrusion on the user’s normal activities. The technique was evaluated using a simulated environment to assess its reliability. Simulation results show that the technique can be applied in various situations such as strict and relaxed security settings by applying different security policies. They also show that the technique is particularly effective where the environment has a mixture of high and low security resources in which case reliability could exceed 99%."

Ubiquitous computing provides any services anywhere and anytime through networks conveniently to improve the quality of life of users. Ubiquitous computing is constructed via a variety of invisible sensors, networks, and computing environments. For multi-purpose sensors, deployment of the topology and topology lifetime are very important depending on wired or wireless sensors. Uneven energy consumption due to integrated routing sensors according to topology deployment types is a factor that degrades the quality of service (QoS) about user convenience services and lifetime of total topology. As a result, a number of studies on maximization of topology lifetime have been conducted. However, previous studies focused on deployment environments and limited sensors so that they cannot be deployed to real sites. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive power management scheme (APMS) that manages sensor power adaptively according to deployment environments to maximize topology lifetime. The APMS maximizes topology lifetime by changing routing paths according to lifetime log to manage sensor power. Furthermore, active responses for optimum topology can be achieved by deploying sensors via simulation prior to sensors deployed to the real environments by users."

However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens?

abstract = "During the last two decades, a “third wave of computing” has emerged: a move from a model of accessing the Internet and other internetworks almost exclusively via a desktop computer to alternative forms of distributed information technologies, such as smartphones, wearable computers, and sensors and microprocessors embedded in everyday objects. This paper undertakes a critical review of the literature that offers and discusses definitions of this “third wave”. Not surprisingly in an area of innovation, definitions are evolving, overlapping and inconsistent. This paper analyses and consolidates the literature in order to identify the key aspects of this new phenomenon. We have coined the term “eObjects”1 for the central element of the “third wave”. The paper presents a framework for research into the technologies and their implications, distinguishing core from common attributes, and identifying categories of inter-device interaction. A subsequent paper will apply the research framework to legal research, with the intention of understanding areas in which litigation can be anticipated, and uncovering areas where the law may not adequately deal with emergent social and business practices."

We propose a self-adaptive pervasive fall detection approach that is robust to the heterogeneity of real life situations.

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution."

Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) seeks to overcome the issues by following the idea of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The CaaS delivery model attempts to separate context service consumers from context service providers. However, CaaS shifts the complexities of context service provisioning and management from consumers toward providers. Considering the merits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in coping with the complexities of problems in different domains, we leverage MDD in the CaaS domain and propose the CaaSSET framework to ease the development of context services. A prerequisite for realizing this aim is to specify the CaaS domain as a meta-model. Our CaaSSET framework consists of a CaaS reference model, a context service meta-model, a graphical modeling tool, a code generation tool, and a context service management tool. Using CaaSSET, the context services are modeled in a graphical environment and transformed into executable context web services (semi-) automatically. To evaluate the applicability of the CaaSSET framework, we have modeled and developed a tourism context service as a case study. We have also compared the framework with the related work based on 44 evaluation criteria, which we have extracted from 14 context service requirements."

With TYDR, we track a larger variety of smartphone data than similar existing apps, including metadata on notifications, photos taken, and music played back by the user. For the development of TYDR, we introduce a general context data model consisting of four categories that focus on the user’s different types of interactions with the smartphone: physical conditions and activity, device status and usage, core functions usage, and app usage. On top of this, we develop the privacy model PM-MoDaC specifically for apps related to the collection of mobile data, consisting of nine proposed privacy measures. We present the implementation of all of those measures in TYDR. Although the utilization of the user’s personality based on the usage of his or her smartphone is a challenging endeavor, it seems to be a promising approach for various types of context-aware mobile applications."

However, the collected contents also severely threat the security and privacy for individuals, as these contents achieve a fine-grained coverage of one’s behaviors and movements. Local differential privacy, as one of the widely accepted properties, enables individuals to contribute to data collection while remaining indistinguishable against adversaries. However, existing solutions and mechanisms fail to capture the contents with relatively low frequency, e.g., the temperature in local regions visited by very few people. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for distinct content estimation under local differential privacy. We propose a hash function and random response based framework for the estimation. The framework allows individuals in the ubiquitous computing system to participate with flexible bandwidth, and properly assigns the given bandwidth to improve estimated results. We prove the optimization problem of assignment in our framework to be NP-complete, and provides an effective heuristic algorithm. Our framework is also proved to guarantee an unbiased estimation for distinct contents, and achieves local differential privacy for users. Meanwhile, we also propose a randomized algorithm designed for more general cases, where the preposed knowledge for the first algorithm is unavailable. Finally, we evaluate both algorithms on real world datasets, and the results reveal that our algorithms outperform existing methods."

The approach is to focus on presenting functionality in a GUI rather than attaching functionality to manually added components. We see this as an inverted way of working with GUI development. The solution was realized in the form of a graphical editor for a PalCom specific User Interface Description Language. The tool produces platform independent GUI descriptions that can be interpreted on any platform. When compared to another common tool, the presented editor exhibited roughly 10x shorter development times. The learning time for new users was also evaluated with positive outcome, and a scalability evaluation showed that the solution can be used to create professional grade GUIs."

In an ageing world population more citizens are at risk of cognitive impairment, with negative consequences on their ability of independent living, quality of life and sustainability of healthcare systems. Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective.
Methods
A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level.
Results
We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates."

Context-aware applications need to react and adapt to changes in their computing environment, which is in general ubiquitous and inherently distributed. Therefore, the context communication faces the problem of context representations heterogeneity, the limitation of devices capacity and network bandwidth. In order to overcome this challenging issue, a particular management of the context is required either for its collection, update, and exchange. In this paper, we propose an approach to manage the context in ubiquitous environments based on the semantic representation of the context and its update using standard languages such as RDF and RDF(s). Our proposed approach provides the simplicity and flexibility that allow the developer to express the context without the need for a unified context model. The results of the experimentation carried out using a prototype implementation of a middleware supports the proposed approach, are in favour of using our approach in the case of resource-constrained devices and network."

In pervasive computing environment, the combination of ubiquitous overlay networks and the capacity of multihoming can provide the possibility of exploiting plentiful available paths. Thus, we introduce a Pervasive Multipath Architecture (PEMA), in which we use the game theory to investigate the selfish strategic collaboration of multiple heterogeneous overlays when they are allowed to use the massively-multipath transfer. Overlay networks are modeled as “players” in this multipath selection game, and we study the asymmetric case where all overlays have different Round Trip Times (RTT) and different degrees of waste. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE). In addition, we find that overlays differing only in their RTTs still receive proportional throughput shares and utilities at the NE. However, if overlays differ only in their degrees of waste, a more wasteful overlay has a larger utility and a larger throughput (bandwidth) share than a less wasteful overlay. Since maintaining connected paths consumes resource, we further consider a more generalized cost function where an overlay’s total resource consumption includes both transferring data packets and maintaining path connections. In this general game, we find that the overlay is more conservative, which opens smaller number of paths and obtains smaller efficiency loss at the NE than in other simplified games. Our simulations confirm the effectiveness and friendliness of multipath transfer for a range of path numbers and in the presence of multi-overlay traffic."

Pervasive computing applications can be formulated on top of the IoT involving nodes that can interact with their environment and perform various processing tasks. Any task is part of intelligent services executed in nodes or the back end infrastructure for supporting end users’ applications. In this setting, one can identify the need for applying updates in the software/firmware of the autonomous nodes. Updates are extensions or patches significant for the efficient functioning of nodes. Legacy methodologies deal with centralized approaches where complex protocols are adopted to support the distribution of the updates in the entire network. In this paper, we depart from the relevant literature and propose a distributed model where each node is responsible to, independently, initiate and conclude the update process. Nodes monitor a set of metrics related to their load and the performance of the network and through a time-optimized scheme identify the appropriate time to conclude the update process. We report on an infinite horizon optimal stopping model on top of the collected performance data. The aim is to make nodes capable of identifying when their performance and the performance of the network are of high quality to efficiently conclude the update process. We provide specific formulations and the analysis of the problem while extensive simulations and a comparison assessment reveal the advantages of the proposed solution."

This paper introduces and prospects an emerging research area – the Embedded Intelligence (EI). This field aims at revealing the individual behaviours, spatial contexts, as well as social patterns and urban dynamics by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting with Internet of smart things (cameras, smart cars, smart cards, etc). In the agricultural sector we add mining of existing technology (books, articles, blue prints) to generate high depth ontologies or metadata and knowledge extraction from Big Data for reasoning and making pro-active decisions using open data information. We include intelligent data analysis to discover new knowledge from data records. The paper discusses the research history, characteristics, general architecture, major applications, and research issues of EI and exemplifies an application of the team in IOT smart irrigation. The purpose of presenting it as a Technology Roadmap (TRM) was to clarify the challenges and opportunities in the general area of “Intelligent Building Technologies” (IBT) and more specifically to smart greenhouses, smart irrigation, or smart crop management. The understanding of smart agriculture is important to be identified by the scientific community as a significant issue because it is needed for nations to develop and adopt these emerging technologies. Global interoperability is of key importance, and so it is a common understanding of values such as privacy and security, based on open, fair and transparent international standards."

Nodes are capable of interacting each other and/or collect/process huge volumes of ambient data. Any service or application executed on top of the collected data is hosted by the operating software/firmware of nodes, thus, such software should be up-to-date. Legacy techniques dealing with the update task cannot efficiently support it due to the adopted centralized approach that suffers from a number of disadvantages. In this paper, we go a step forward and propose a time-optimized and network performance-aware model for initiating and concluding the update process. Our aim is to have the nodes independently deciding the initiation of the update process by finding the appropriate time to execute it. Every node acts autonomously and monitors the network's performance to find a slot where performance parameters advocate for an efficient and uninterrupted conclusion of the update task. Hence, the proposed model can be adapted to the environment and the status of each node. The final decision is made taking into consideration multiple parameters and it is based on the solution of the widely known Secretary Problem (SP) originated in the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST). We provide the description of the problem, specific formulations and the analysis of our solution while extensive experiments reveal the advantages of the proposed scheme."

In this paper, we present XWARE, an interoperability framework that allows to integrate discovery and interaction of different middleware platforms. The flexible design allows to configure and extend the interoperability framework in order to add new platforms and tailor it for the use in different domains. Furthermore, XWARE instances can communicate with each other enabling interoperability in smart environments as well as in smart peer groups. The feasibility of our approach is discussed and evaluated based on the integration of five different platforms."

So far, many of PDs do not provide a means of interaction acting only act as output devices that present information. On the other hand, smartphones have become increasingly popular due to their number of users, inherent properties and power. It has been argued that digital information is required for most meetings, whether formal or informal. With technological improvement and the growing of the ubiquity of both PDs and smartphones, streaming data between devices should be done smoothly in formal or informal meetings. While many possibilities exist for communication between such devices, file sharing in these scenarios is still restricted. These solutions also focus only on new mechanisms for interaction with PDs and ignore PDs’ primary function of displaying information. To solve this problem, we present a novel technique that allows users to transfer different types of files while preserving the security of these files. The technique will be particularly used to transfer files from smartphones to PDs in various kinds of meetings. The system combines both traditional uses of PDs (such as displaying announcements) and interactive ways of giving real-time presentations by uploading files, marking important parts of pages and writing notes. The findings imply that a majority of users are ready to use the system. Furthermore, the systems's performance evaluation results are very encouraging and reveal that the deployed tool is an effective method that can be a reasonable alternative to using projectors."

In order to help designers on this engineering process, we propose in this paper a roadmap on context management and a requirements elicitation process. This roadmap aims at sharing with non-expert designers the necessary expertise on context management allowing them to better understand the notion of context and its challenges. The elicitation process aims at guiding these non-expert designers across the roadmap, supporting them in their requirements elicitation process concerning context management.

We first frame the various dimensions along which nature-inspired coordination models can be defined, and survey the most relevant proposals in the area. We describe the nature-inspired coordination model developed within the SAPERE project as a synthesis of existing approaches, and show how it can effectively support the multifold requirements of modern and emerging pervasive services. We conclude by identifying what we think are the open research challenges in this area, and identify some research directions that we believe are promising."

Semantic Web technologies provide a uniform framework for capturing these properties. Offering powerful representation facilities and reasoning techniques, these technologies are rapidly gaining attention towards facing a range of issues such as data and knowledge modelling, querying, reasoning, service discovery, privacy and provenance. This article reviews the application of the Semantic Web to pervasive and sensor-driven systems with a focus on information modelling and reasoning along with streaming data and uncertainty handling. The strengths and weaknesses of current and projected approaches are analysed and a roadmap is derived for using the Semantic Web as a platform, on which open, standard-based, pervasive, adaptive and sensor-driven systems can be deployed."

We offer three primary axes through which a categorisation of multiplicitous media forms can be framed: substrate versus object; composed versus self-organised, and homogeneous versus heterogeneous.

Obfuscation techniques are desirable in reducing the impact of disclosing confidential information but with a significant loss of utility of information content. Thus, accesses to confidential data by mobile users need to be controlled so as to minimize the disclosure risks. To achieve these requirements, we propose a novel location-dependent disclosure risk based decision support framework for persistent authentication and data access management. We have derived the location dependent identity based disclosure risks at record level and file level by using the search theory and entropy. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed model using multi-level security model and fuzzy sets. We have further proved that our proposed technique can significantly reduce the impact of common privacy attacks by performing a comprehensive security analysis. In conclusion, this research presents a novel location-dependent disclosure risk-based decision support framework persistent authentication and a pragmatic data access management approach for highly privacy-sensitive pervasive computing applications."

In this article, we reflect on the ways in which ideas of animal-centric development may impact the development of technology for animals in practice. We start by looking at the process of development for and with animals, and propose a development model facilitating the principles of Agility, Welfare of Animals, and eXperts’ involvement (AWAX) within the development lifecycle. While promoting the animal-centric approach, it is important to acknowledge that an animal usually uses technology through humans and in a particular environment. We further extend the AWAX model to include considerations of the human in the loop and the environment, and discuss some practical implications of this view, including aspects such as security and privacy."

Recent models consider this behavior as a combination of both social and spatial factors. Yet, establishing accurate traces of human groups is difficult: current techniques capture either positions, or contacts, with a limited accuracy. In this paper we introduce a new technique to capture such behaviors. The interest of this approach lies in the unprecedented accuracy at which both positions and orientations of humans, even gathered in a crowd, are captured. The open-source software pipeline we developed to exploit captured data allows extraction of several metrics on movement and social contacts, and permits study of their respective interrelationship. From the mobility to the topological connectivity, this framework offers a layered approach that can be tailored, allowing to compare and reason about models and traces. We demonstrate the accuracy and validity of our approach on social events and calibration runs in which we captured the motions of humans. In particular, we introduce an open-access trace of 50 individuals and compare it against random waypoint models that have the same global characteristics. Our fine-grain analyses, that take into account social interactions between users, show that the random way point model does not provide accurate predictions for socially-induced motion; to model human kinetics, new group- and interaction-based models should be developed. From the computer science point of view, these models are required to fully exploit the power of human-centered mobile computing, crucial for ubiquitous computing, and referred to as Short Range Communication Systems, Mobile Opportunistic Networking, or Mobile Networking in Proximity."

Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies."

However, due to privacy concerns, many social media users do not share their exact geographical coordinates. In this paper, we describe our technique that predicts locations of posts that are not associated with explicit coordinates, a process called geolocation. Existing research has utilized the content of a post as well as the post author’s social media relationships with other users to estimate location. Our research provides a novel approach to geolocation by combining multiple techniques, as well as adding a new technique: estimating location by clustering similar social media posts that are centered in a geographical area."

Thus, the topic of providing additional protection such as All-Or-Nothing (AON) data protection scheme has drawn interest from a large number of researchers and practitioners. Many data protection methods based on this AON data protection concepts are developed aiming to enhance the classical encryption schemes. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we collate research works across a number of topics in AON, from historical developments to the recent research proposal. By introducing new definitions and category methods, we hope to provide useful reference and perspectives for the state of AON research and development."

The management and prevention of these diseases can be done by controlling the behavioral and biological risk factors which are related to them. ChronicPrediction is an intelligent system for noncommunicable diseases care which determines in real time the impact on risk factors due to actions taken by users. Based on impact information, the system presents on users’ smartphones strategic messages to help in their treatment. ChronicPrediction applies Bayesian Networks (BNs) which use risk factors for mapping the causes of noncommunicable diseases worsening. The support to multiple chronic diseases and the integrated use of multiple BNs based on risk factors are the main contributions of this work and differentiate the proposed system from related work. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first one successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ChronicPrediction to support BNs based on risk factors and the sending of messages to users’ smartphones. The evaluation involved the building of a BN for predicting coronary artery disease made with real world data obtained in a prospective cohort study. The study involved 302 patients from a hospital localized in southern Brazil. The second experiment assessed the ChronicPrediction support to multiple BNs at same time. The test involved the previous BN and another from a thirty part research work to map risk factors of diabetes. The results were encouraging and show potential for implementing ChronicPrediction in real-life situations."

Context-aware software systems can interact with different devices to complete their tasks and act according to the context, regardless of their development and organizational differences. Interoperability is a big challenge in the engineering of such systems.
Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability."

However, it still presents a number of challenges, both for the full implementation of technologies and for the integration with existing information systems. One of the main mismatches evidenced by recent works is how context-awareness, a widely used capability in ubiquitous computing and actual information systems with relational databases may be integrated to allow ubiquitous and traditional systems to query relational data sources without the necessity to modify the schema of the database. This paper presents an integration model relating context and domain information allowing relational data to be retrieved in context without the necessity to change the originally used relational queries. A set of linking rules and algorithms are formalized in a model and this model is implemented in a prototype. The evaluation of the model is performed by applying it in a case study in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. The evaluation of the model by the application of it in a case study in a MOOC platform demonstrated the possibility to use an ontology frequently used in ubiquitous middleware as an extra filtering layer for information systems without the necessity to recreate queries or make a re-engineering in the relational database schema. The results of the queries after the application of the model showed an average decrease of 21% in returned tuples, which was evaluated as a significant reduce in tuple results."

Currently, most sensor-based activity recognition techniques rely on supervised learning algorithms. However, the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities in smart homes is expensive and violates the individual’s privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel hybrid approach that couples collaborative active learning with probabilistic and knowledge-based reasoning. The rationale of our approach is that a generic, and possibly incomplete, knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method exploiting users’ feedback to (i) refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology, and (ii) mine temporal patterns of sensor events that are frequently generated by the execution of specific activities. A Markov Logic Network is used to recognize activities with probabilistic rules that capture both the ontological knowledge and the information obtained by active learning. We experimented our solution with a real-world dataset of activities carried out by several individuals in an interleaved fashion. Experimental results show that our collaborative and personalized active learning solution significantly improves recognition rates, while triggering a small number of feedback requests. Moreover, the overall recognition rates compare favorably with existing supervised and unsupervised activity recognition methods."

In this paper, we study important design considerations and technical limitations for realizing such a device, and then we propose D2ART (Direct Data Accessing from Passive RFID Tag) that not only performs as a normal passive RFID tag for identification, but also provides rich information such as multimedia to a reader with extreme low power consumption.

Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human–(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the “ICT biographies” of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging ICT users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy ICT users in relation to younger “generations”, for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on ICT and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing ICT practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography?"

To our knowledge, this is the first work to address the privacy issue of the RTB paradigm. We present a formal proof for the security of Pri-RTB under the assumption of the decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH) problem. We analyze and elaborate the superiority of Pri-RTB over other related works. We also developed a prototype for Pri-RTB and conducted several experiments to evaluate its feasibility and efficiency under different parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that Pri-RTB can work highly efficiently in a practical setting (for example, a scenario with approximately 200 advertisers per auction)."

Many approaches propose the synthesis of mediators. Unfortunately, a rigorous characterization of the concept of interoperability is still lacking, hence making hard to assess their applicability and soundness. In this paper, we provide a framework for the synthesis of mediators that allows us to: (i) characterize the conditions for the mediator existence and correctness; and (ii) establish the applicability boundaries of the synthesis method."

Nevertheless, when two users are at the first interaction, they have no historical data involving their own activities to be analyzed, and then use information (recommender-data) provided by other users (recommenders) who, in the past, have had interactions with one of the involved parties. Although this approach has proven to be effective, it might fail if dishonest recommenders provide unfair recommender-data. Indeed, such unfair data may lead to skewed evaluations, and therefore either increase the trustworthiness of a malicious user or reduce the one of a honest user in a fraudulent way. In this work, we propose an algorithm for identifying false recommender-data. Our attention is explicitly focused on recommender-data rather than recommenders. This because some recommenders could provide recommender-data containing only a limited (but specific) set of altered information. This is used by dishonest recommenders as a tactic to avoid being discovered. The proposed algorithm uses association rules to express a confidence-based measure (reputation rank), which is used as a reliability ranking of the recommender-data. The resulting approach has been compared with other existing ones in this field, resulting more accurate in finding out unfair recommender-data sent by dishonest recommenders."

And one of the most significant discussions in this field is how to adapt the learning rate and convergent path dynamically. This paper proposes a gradient-based algorithm called Adacom, that is based on an adaptive control system and momentum. Critically inheriting the previous studies, a reference model is introduced to generate the update. The method reduces noise and decides on paths with less oscillation, while maintaining the accumulated learning rate. Due to system design properties, the method requires fewer hyper-parameters for tuning. We state the prospect of Adacom as a general optimizer in Autonomous Cloud, and explore the potential of Adacom for pervasive computing by the assumption of transition data. Then we demonstrate the convergence of Adacom theoretically. The evaluations over the simulated transition data prove the feasibility and superiority of Adacom with other gradient-based methods."

Human-like system capabilities are not generally desirable there. But, recent trends in industrial robotics demand robust, flexible and efficient robots with a certain level of autonomy.

This paper reveals how a context-based reasoning can be used to achieve an intelligent robot group behavior. In order to achieve adaptivity, self-recovery or scalability of the system, a COgnitive MOdel for the Robot group control (COMOR) is developed. COMOR can be understood as an interpreter used to transform high-level context to low-level data, allowing machines to make context-based decisions. COMOR has three main parts and relies on a simulated Social Capital phenomenon as a feature of people. The first part is used to collect significant information from the environment. The second part is used to provide a set of possible solutions respecting the semantic domain description. The last part of COMOR is used to provide a behavioral component ensuring an optimal solution to given environmental conditions."

Recently, with substantial development of pervasive/ubiquitous computing technology in recent decades, the relevant applications in areas such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, remote sensing, and remote healthcare have entered people's lives and gradually become prevalent. Furthermore, determining how to continuously supply power to those micro devices or components embedded into vehicles, mini-sensors, or heart pacemakers has also become a critical issue. Self-powered technology based on nanogenerators appears to be a promising development opportunity, particularly after another better nanogenerator; namely, the triboelectric nanogenerator, was invented around 2011, at which point the relevant studies of SPT appeared to enter a new era.

Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development."

In such monitoring systems, the sensor nodes at the network boundary require remaining vigilant to detect events like objects entering and leaving the area under surveillance. Nodes performing surveillance of target area can be classified as boundary node and others as an interior node. Due to continuous vigilance, boundary node suffers from quicker energy exhaustion (compare to internal nodes) which results to a shorter life span of the node. None of the reported works on boundary detection algorithms have considered the problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes. The problem of maximizing the lifetime of boundary nodes collectively addresses the problem of an optimal number of boundary nodes detection and maximization of boundary node’s lifetime. In this work, we formulate the problem of the maximum lifetime of the boundary as the problem of partitioning the boundary region of the network into disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region with the aim of maximizing the number of disjoint dominating sets of a boundary region in the network. This is the problem of the domatic partition of boundary region in graph theory, where each partition is dominating the set of boundary region (i.e., not the dominating set of entire network). Rotating the disjoint dominating sets of boundary region in the network resulting into maximizing the lifetimes of boundary nodes. We found that our disjoint dominating sets of boundary region algorithm have an approximation ratio ((4.8+ln5)opt+1.2), where opt is the minimum size dominating set which has the same approximation ratio as the minimum dominating set problem. The time complexity of boundary detection algorithm is O(mn2) where m=|Euk∖1|, n=|Nuk∖1| and k is the radius of graph. Simulation results reveal that using our proposed domatic partition of boundary region algorithm, the boundary node saves 35.71% energy lesser as compared to without domatic partition based boundary detection algorithm. To support our claim, we extended our work one step further and performed the experimental analysis of our proposed algorithm on telosb motes."

It infers the difficult-to-measure tool wear parameters (e.g. tool wear width) by fusing in-process multisensory data (e.g. force, vibration, etc.) with dimension reduction technique and support vector regression model. Different state-of-the-art dimension reduction techniques including kernel principal component analysis, locally linear embedding, isometric feature mapping, and minimum redundancy maximum relevant method have been investigated for feature fusion in a virtual sensing model, and the kernel principal component analysis performs best in terms of sensing accuracy. The effectiveness of the developed virtual tool wear sensing technique is experimentally validated in a set of machining tool run-to-failure tests on a computer numerical control milling machine. The results show that the estimated tool wear width through virtual sensing is comparable to that measured offline by a microscope instrument in terms of accuracy, moreover, in a more cost-effective manner."

The monitoring application should track the production process, identifying the production stage and detecting anomaly in every stage as defined. With the development of ubiquitous computing technology and widespread of sensing equipment, context information pertaining to smart working environment is available for monitoring applications. Complex event processing (CEP) is usually introduced to process and correlate context information for its attractive feature of extracting composite event from a large amount of event data in real time according to user-defined event patterns. In this paper, we present context model and event model in which discrete event such as acquiring context value at a point of time is represented by context. The abnormal situation in every stage of production can be transformed into event expressions, called abnormal event patterns. Contexts in different time captured by sensors form data streams and processed by CEP engine to detect abnormal situation. We propose to use state transition to model each stage so that the normal transition period in the beginning and end of stage can be distinguished from abnormal situation. Once a stage is identified to be starting or ending, the application will change abnormal event patterns accordingly. Case study about metallographic examination proves that the approach we propose is effective and feasible for some multi-stage abnormal situation monitoring."

We propose a textile wearable device which enables a multimodal sensing input for an eyes-free mobile interaction during daily activities. Although existing input devices possess multimodal sensing capabilities with a small form factor, they still suffer from deficiencies in compactness and softness due to the nature of embedded materials and components. For our prototype, we paint a conductive silicone rubber on a single layer of textile and stitch conductive threads. From a single layer of the textile, multimodal sensing (strain and pressure) values are extracted via voltage dividers. A regression analysis, multi-level thresholding and a temporal position tracking algorithm are applied to capture the different levels and modes of finger interactions to support the input taxonomy. We then demonstrate example applications with interaction design allowing users to control existing mobile, wearable, and digital devices. The evaluation results confirm that the prototype can achieve an accuracy of ≥80% for demonstrating all input types, ≥88% for locating the specific interaction areas for eyes-free interaction, and the robustness during daily activity related motions. Multitasking study reveals that our prototype promotes relatively fast response with low perceived workload comparing to existing eyes-free input."

Yet, this computing paradigm suffers when the available resources–such as energy in the network, CPU cycles, memory, I/O data rate–are limited. In this article, the new paradigm of approximate computing is proposed to harness such potential and to enable real-time computation-intensive mobile applications in resource-limited and uncertain environments. A reduction in time and energy consumed by an application is obtained via approximate computing by decreasing the amount of computation needed; such improvement, however, comes with the potential loss in accuracy. Hence, a Mobile Distributed Computing framework, is introduced to determine offline the ‘approximable’ tasks in an application and a light-weight online algorithm is devised to select the approximate version of the tasks in an application during run time. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation and testbed experiments by comparing approximate versus exact-computation performance."

abstract = "The era of the Internet of Things (IoT) involves a huge number of autonomous devices (nodes) capable of monitoring and interacting with their environment. The autonomous devices are also able of being interconnected, thus, they can exchange data. Pervasive computing applications can be built on top of this infrastructure offering efficient solutions for multiple domains. Nodes can execute intelligent, light-weight processing of the collected data being capable of responding in case of events. Apart from the software necessary to perform the discussed processing tasks, nodes are coming with pre-installed software necessary to perform basic functionalities e.g., communication. When nodes act in dynamic environments, it is necessary to update the software necessary for their functionalities. Updates involve software extensions and patches important to secure a high level performance of the IoT nodes. In this paper, we propose a distributed updates management scheme enhancing the autonomous nature of nodes. Legacy models deal with centralized approaches (i.e., a central server) where complex algorithms are adopted to derive the protocols for the distribution of the updates. In our approach, each node is responsible to, independently, initiate and conclude the update process. The central server is responsible only for indicating when the updates are available to the nodes. Every node monitors a set of performance metrics (either for the node itself or the network) and based on an intelligent scheme decides the appropriate time to conclude the update process. We adopt an ensemble forecasting model on top of a pool of estimators and an optimization model to derive the right time for initiating the update process. We are based on the solution of the known Santa Fe bar problem to perform load balancing in the retrieval of the updates. The aim is to have the nodes deciding the conclusion of the update process in different time intervals, thus, to keep the load of the network at low levels. We provide specific formulations and the analysis of our problem while extensive simulations and a comparison assessment reveal the advantages of the proposed solution."

Originally defined in the computer sciences domain, the term Cyber–Physical Systems has been adapted to very different domains such as the control theory or electronic engineering. Even, some authors understand CPS as a particular scenario of the Internet of Things (IoT) based on pervasive sensing. Furthermore, recently, some works propose a definition for CPS including all the features described in the different domains. In this paper we provide a comprehensive analysis of the nature and characteristics of the different proposals, discuss the recent attempts to standardize CPS, and review the state-of-the-art on CPS for each technological domain. We compare those different proposals on CPS, discuss about some related terms and technologies and conclude by describing the main research challenges in the area."

As ubiquitous computing evolves with increased mobile use (e.g. smartphones, heads-up displays, wearable devices), safety is becoming increasingly needed, especially in urban environments. However, safety was not a major concern in human-computer interaction (HCI), and owing to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, it is highly challenging to develop a framework to deal with safety issues. In this paper, we discussed the development of a conceptual framework for evaluating and improving safety for pedestrians using smartphones while walking in safety-critical environments. A preliminary questionnaire based study was conducted to collect smartphone users’ opinions and attitudes towards using smartphones while walking. Some safety-critical details were also collected to address the users’ needs in interaction design. The proposed framework was explored in theoretical, hardware and software levels respectively, which could provide insights for both ergonomists, application designers and researchers."

Therefore, meeting the need for personalized visual comfort whilst achieving energy efficiency in open-plan office environment has been an open challenge. However, recent technological advancements in distributed sensing, pervasive computing, context-awareness and machine learning is progressively closing this gap. This article introduces ReViCEE–a simple recommender systems based approach to learn both individual and collaborative user-preferences from historical data and offer recommendations for intelligent building lighting controls. The intelligence in this case is achieved by being able to derive set-points to control task lights such that it balances personalized visual comfort without compromising on energy savings. The proposed approach has been developed using Python and implemented on a real test-bed in an university campus office building in National University of Singapore. The evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out for two months using field experiments involving distributed wireless sensor actuator network (WSAN) and multiple occupants having varied visual sensation. The novelty lies in proposing a new inter-disciplinary approach that supports smart and intelligent buildings paradigm by learning and predicting optimum individual user-preferences towards energy efficient control of personalized light. The results obtained from field experiments present a potential energy savings upto 72% when compared to the conventional lighting systems used."

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm for segmenting time-series signals, in which window boundaries are dynamically adjusted when the probability of correct classification is low. Our proposed scheme is benchmarked using an audio-based nutrition-monitoring case-study. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm improves the number of correctly classified instances from a baseline of 75%–94% using the RandomForest classifier."

In this paper, an eigendecomposition method is proposed to capture the common patterns of passengers’ variation over time among all metro stations as well as to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the dynamic space around the metro stations based on the common patterns with low dimensional structures. Using Shenzhen as a case study, four datasets for check-in/check-out and weekday/weekend are decomposed to obtain the principal components (PCs) and eigenvectors. The first several PCs are the most common patterns of passengers’ variation over time among all metro stations, while the corresponding elements in the eigenvectors, referred to as EigenStation in this paper, can describe the characteristics of the metro station. The decomposition result is evaluated at both the aggregation and individual station levels, and the result demonstrates that the first two elements of the EigenStation can approximate the original dataset. The EigenStation vector angle, i.e., ω, is used to represent the structure of the EigenStation, and its value is highly related to the land use structure around the metro stations. The proposed method can provide deep insight into static and dynamic urban spaces, which can help improve urban planning around metro stations."

To derive the exact number of loading/unloading spaces from the inexact information, a quadratic programming problem was formulated and solved. In addition, driver location and speed were modeled using fuzzy numbers to account for the uncertainty of their locations. Subsequently, fuzzy cross-referencing was used so that loading/unloading space information can be referenced from more than one location.

Studies have revealed that non-adherence to prescribed medication can lead to hospital readmissions, clinical complications, and other negative patient outcomes. Though many techniques have been proposed to improve patient adherence rates, they suffer from low accuracy. Our objective is to develop and test a novel system for assessment of medication adherence.
Methods
Recently, several smart pill bottle technologies have been proposed, which can detect when the bottle has been opened, and even when a pill has been retrieved. However, very few systems can determine if the pill is subsequently ingested or discarded. We propose a system for detecting user adherence to medication using a smart necklace, capable of determining if the medication has been ingested based on the skin movement in the lower part of the neck during a swallow. This, coupled with existing medication adherence systems that detect when medicine is removed from the bottle, can detect a broader range of use-cases with respect to medication adherence.
Results
Using Bayesian networks, we were able to correctly classify between chewable vitamins, saliva swallows, medication capsules, speaking, and drinking water, with average precision and recall of 90.17% and 88.9%, respectively. A total of 135 instances were classified from a total of 20 subjects.
Conclusion
Our experimental evaluations confirm the accuracy of the piezoelectric necklace for detecting medicine swallows and disambiguating them from related actions. Further studies in real-world conditions are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme."

Public data, on the other hand, can be most effectively disseminated using broadcasting technique (i.e., one way communication). In broadcasting, server(s) generates the broadcast contents and disseminate it through the air channel. The mobile user in search of public data, tunes to the air channel and pulls the desired information. The characteristics of mobile device and limitations of wireless communication technology pose challenges on broadcasting strategy as well as data retrieval algorithms. To reduce the access time and power consumption, major research issues include indexing techniques and data organization on air channel, broadcasting over single and parallel channel(s), data distribution and replication strategy, conflict resolution, and data retrieval methods This article is intended to articulate these challenges, propose several solutions, and through comprehensive simulation demonstrate the validity of the proposed solutions."

However, computing gradients is very problematic in an environment affected by mutability in the position and working frequency of devices: existing algorithms fail in reaching adequate trade-offs between accuracy and reaction speed to environment changes. We propose BIS (Bounded Information Speed) gradient, a fully-distributed algorithm that uses time information to achieve a smooth and predictable reaction speed, and prove it is optimal across algorithms following a single-path-communication strategy to spread information. We empirically evaluate BIS gradient and compare it with other approaches, showing that BIS achieves the best accuracy while keeping smoothness under control, and accordingly provides improved performance when used as building block in more complex algorithms for creating spatial structures and performing distributed collection of data."

In this setting, one can identify the need for applying updates in the software/firmware of the autonomous nodes. Updates may include software extensions and patches significant for the efficient functioning of the IoT nodes. Legacy methodologies involve centralized models where complex algorithms and protocols are adopted for the distribution of the updates to the nodes. This paper proposes a distributed approach where each node is responsible to initiate and conclude the update process. We envision that each node monitors specific performance metrics (related to the node itself and/or the network) and based on a time-optimized scheme identifies the appropriate time to perform the update process.We propose the adoption of a finite horizon optimal stopping scheme. Our stopping model originates in the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) and takes into account multiple performance metrics. The aim is to have the nodes capable of identifying when their performance and the performance of the network are of high quality. In that time, nodes could be able to efficiently conclude the update process. We provide a set of formulations and the analysis of our problem.

First, the application logic has to be analyzed and then separated into a set of distributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to be implemented for the specific hardware. Apart from handling these issues, they have to deal with other aspects of life-cycle such as changes in application requirements and deployed devices. Several approaches have been proposed in the closely related fields of wireless sensor network, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and software engineering in general to address the above challenges. However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach for addressing the above mentioned challenges. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a development methodology that separates IoT application development into different concerns and provides a conceptual framework to develop an application, (2) a development framework that implements the development methodology to support actions of stakeholders. The development framework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development concern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates code generation, task-mapping, and linking techniques to provide automation. Code generation supports the application development phase by producing a programming framework that allows stakeholders to focus on the application logic, while our mapping and linking techniques together support the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed system collaboratively hosted by individual devices. Our evaluation based on two realistic scenarios shows that the use of our approach improves the productivity of stakeholders involved in the application development."

The advent of pervasive computing has enabled companies to continuously adapt to these changing manufacturing situations. In factories of the future the worker and his or her well-being is seen as a crucial part of manufacturing situations. These human factors have to be considered in order to achieve sustainable organizational success. Due to advances in the area of wearable sensors, sensing human properties within a manufacturing setting is technically feasible. Sensing human properties, such as the level of comfort or stress, provides additional information. This allows for continuous adaptation of the manufacturing system behavior based on human needs. In this paper, human-aware modeling and the execution of production processes incorporating human properties are illustrated. This is done by applying the Subject-Oriented Process Management approach in an application scenario. Furthermore, the architecture and the application of the designed system are described with respect to human stress level and dynamic system adaptation."

abstract = "In the contemporary landscape, human interaction is characterized by the pervasive mediation of intelligent agents. Owing to advances in computer science and engineering, phenomena once limited to fixed locations are metamorphosing from extraneous entities to implicit components of the everyday. Computing power has simultaneously enhanced and miniaturized to the extent that contemporary consumer devices demonstrate power equivalent to or greater than that of personal computers of recent memory. At the same time, network connectivity has proliferated to ubiquitous levels, reflected in the fact that the amount of inanimate objects connected to the Internet has recently surpassed the human population of earth. Digitally mediated experiences are thus no longer the province of fixed-line terminals; rather than projecting a virtual avatar of oneself into a synthetic environment, elements of that environment are extricated and placed into the physical domain. In this landscape, the concept of augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a way to visualize the pervasive virtual information woven into the physical environment. However, research on the phenomenon has largely remained technical in nature; the collective body of work which seeks to understand its role in society has remained comparatively limited. This paper aims to bridge the divide between these hitherto disparate research avenues. The paper affords particular attention to the impact of AR on the discipline of marketing communications, as the domain's interest towards phenomenon accelerates; following the motifs of historically innovative phenomena such as television and the Internet. Through a qualitative approach, the paper derives insight from key social actors, resulting in a number of findings used as a foundation to build knowledge on the nascent role of AR in the marketing communications domain. A model is presented which schematizes an approach to the deployment of AR, formalizing the collective intelligence of those key social actors. The aim of the paper is thus to propose heuristics for marketing professionals who seek to implement AR as a component of a communications programme, and increase the collective knowledge of the discipline on this enigmatic phenomenon. The proposed model is dual-natured, highlighting not only the unique attributes of AR, but emphasizing the robustness of traditional best practice values to which its implementation must adhere. The latter represents a recurring theme throughout the research findings; a potentially significant one given the singular nature of the phenomenon and the tendency towards the novel observed in many of its early applications."

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development."

In addition, a desktop application and mobile applications to control the human–computer interface were implemented. Finally, we created experimental EOG eyeglasses and a new detection protocol using the proposed method for long-term step-by-step detection of eye movements and user comfort. The proposed DOSbFC calculates the difference values of accumulated EOG signals between the initial eye movement and fixation time. It allows long-term detection of eye movements with high accuracy and only requires a single calibration. The vertical and ground electrodes of the standard electrode positioning scheme caused discomfort of subjects; the proposed electrode positioning scheme solves these problems and enables the use of existing eyeglasses without design modification. The experimental results demonstrated that the average accuracy of the long-term eye movement detection was 94%, whereas those of the band pass filter and wavelet transform were 61% and 64%, respectively. This was because baseline drift and noise were removed by averaging the signal variations. Further experimental results demonstrated that the average information transfer rate of the proposed method was 6.0, whereas those of the band pass filter and wavelet transform were 1.1 and 0.9, respectively."

There have been huge challenges of controlling access to ubiquitous resources among collaborative multi-servers based on the negotiating security policies on URMs. However, the traditional access control mechanisms were insufficient to meet the requirements of role assignment management for URMs that allow accessing services via huge clients. Therefore, Ubiquitous RBAC (Role-based Access Control) with CBR (case-based reasoning) based negotiation technique is proposed in this paper. The novel RBAC scheme could efficiently manage not only one ubiquitous server, but also multiple ubiquitous servers on the cooperation domain through supporting both negotiating role assignment (NRA) task and cooperative role assignment (CRA) task in URM-platform by using a spiral negotiating process. Furthermore, it solves the difficulties in reducing the costs of ubiquitous computing resources, e.g., the role reassigned rate, handover rate, bandwidth, and power consumption, etc. Due to the ease of use and its efficiency in negotiating and managing the user-to-role as well as virtual role assignment by applying CBR approach, it is a highly powerful strategy of information management for conducting the innovative research and design for ubiquitous RBAC scheme."

This paper describes an augmented reality manufacturing system that aims to greatly improve the information perception of the different types of workers in a manufacturing facility and to make interaction with manufacturing software natural and efficient. In this approach, traditionally paper-based and computer-based tasks are augmented to the workers’ interactions in the environment. The system is distributed and modular as the different functions of CAD/CAM software are provided by individual physical or virtual objects in the environment or by a combination of them working cooperatively. This modularity allows the individual resources and facilities to be linked via internet onto a manufacturing grid with universally-accessible augmented reality interfaces to their services."

Nowadays, loads of people tend to store different types of private and sensitive data in their smartphones including bank account details, personal identifiers, accounts credentials, and credit card details. A lot of people keep their personal e-accounts logged in all the time in their mobile devices. Hence, these mobile devices are prone to different security and privacy threats and attacks from the attackers. Commonly used approaches for securing mobile devices such as passcode, PINs, pattern lock, face recognition, and fingerprint scan are vulnerable and exposed to several attacks including smudge attacks, side-channel attacks, and shoulder-surfing attacks. To address these challenges, a novel continuous authentication scheme is presented in this study, which recognizes smartphone users on the basis of their physical activity patterns using accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors of smartphone. A series of experiments are performed for user recognition using different machine learning classifiers, where six different activities are analyzed for multiple locations of smartphone on the user's body. SVM classifier achieved the best results for user recognition with an overall average accuracy of 97.95%. A comprehensive analysis of the user recognition results validates the efficiency of the proposed scheme."

Internet of Things (IoTs) is an emerging technology that is envisioned to revolutionise the enabling environment and to provide autonomous, ubiquitous and pervasive computing within Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). IoTs are usually associated with the acquisition of sensor node information and controlling of “things”. However, the absence of location information of these sensor nodes compromises the intelligence of the IoT network. Therefore, this work is motivated by the recent advances in the two important areas of WSNs namely, indoor localisation and IoTs. This paper therefore presents a framework that integrates indoor localisation of sensor nodes and IoTs in a real world scenario. The focus is mainly on the implementation issues regarding localisation algorithm complexity, hardware computational capabilities and Internet/Intranet enabled connectivity for access to the sensor nodes’ location information. A sensor node prototype is developed using specialised electronic components and proprietary protocols to provide a capable platform for embedding a distributive online localisation algorithm based on Received Signal Strength (RSSI) and Gauss-Newton Algorithm (GNA). The algorithm is first simulated before porting it to the sensor node prototypes. A gateway device and an IoT framework are also proposed and implemented based on Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) server to provide global and local access to sensor nodes’ location information. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the IoT logged estimated coordinates from the prototype nodes and the estimated coordinates from the simulation are computed and compared. The computational power of the hardware is analysed based the time it takes to perform the GNA based localisation process."

The IoT network is comprised of numerous and heterogeneous devices that are capable of generating large amounts of events. To enable the IoT paradigm, it is necessary to integrate, process, and react to events on the fly.
Objective
The goal of this paper is to support the increased demands of scalability, flexibility, autonomy, and heterogeneity for IoT event processing. A distributed architectural model based on Situational Awareness, named EXEHDA-SA, was designed to provide event collection, hybrid processing, and customizable and dynamic reaction features.
Method
The conception of the model was based on a middleware for ubiquitous computing called EXEHDA, thus benefiting from its already defined strategies. The proposal follows a multi-level strategy and consists of three hierarchically interconnected modular components.
Results
Our main contribution is the conception and validation of a model for event collection, processing and reaction for modern distributed environments. The contribution is evidenced through experiments performed on a prototype implemented on consolidated free and open source technologies. The experiments are made up of five case studies where each one evaluates a scenario for IoT demands.
Conclusion
Through these case studies which were proposed in information security area, we demonstrated the feasibility of this proposal for deployment in IoT production environments. Furthermore, EXEHDA-SA is able to operate on different scenarios due to each component modularity and its consequent extensibility."

abstract = "Ubiquitous computing involving complex interactive systems are leading to increase in cognitive load in day to day activities. Apart from causing stress and mental exhaustion, increase in cognitive load is likely to cause expensive human errors in case of critical tasks. Though subjective measures of cognitive load are in use in HCI, there is a need to explore non-invasive and non-intrusive physiological measures of cognitive load. This paper discusses the theory of cognitive load, identifies EEG frequency bands likely to capture the cognitive load, discusses brain locations related to the cognitive load based on literature, proposes a methodology to measure cognitive load using EEG power spectrum and verifies the framework by an experimental study."

Owing to its structure, HIBE can be deployed to provide access control in cloud, pervasive computing systems, wireless sensor networks and Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). Additionally, HIBE can be used to perform search on encrypted data, forward secure encryption, fully private communication, limited delegation and damage control. This paper evaluates different approaches in the construction of HIBE protocols to determine practical frameworks. Specific criterions like cryptographic proof models, tightness of the reduction, recipient anonymity, hardness assumptions, bounded depth, revocability, types of pairing and ciphertext indistinguishability properties, were used as benchmarks for assessing each scheme. The efficiency in terms of storage and computation overhead, was estimated to identify suitable protocols for securing different computing environments. The future prospective applications of HIBE protocols were also investigated."

Context-aware systems are able to change their behaviour depending on new conditions regarding the user, the platform and the environment. These systems are evolving towards interacting with the user in a transparent and ubiquitous manner, especially by means of different types of sensors, which can gather a wide range of data from the user, the platform the user is interacting with, and the environment where such interaction is taking place. It is worth noting that the software architecture of a system is a key artefact during its development and its adaptation process. Hence, the definition of the software architecture becomes essential while developing context-aware systems since it should reflect how the context is tackled for adaptation purposes. With the aim of studying this issue, we have designed and conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview about the different architectural approaches used in context-aware systems. One of the main findings of this study is that there are not many software architecture proposals that deal with context-awareness in an explicit way during the adaptation process. It was also detected that there are Human Computer Interaction (HCI) works that focus on context-aware adaptations but neglect partially or completely any possible change in the system architecture during the adaptation process. Due to this, we perceived a need to analyse what research works highlight the use of context and its relationship to the software architecture in existing context-aware systems. Therefore, this mapping study attempts to bridge the gap between Software Architecture and HCI in order to align the adaptation at the architectural level (changes in the configuration of architectural components) and at the HCI level (changes in the interaction modality or the user interface in general)."

Bringing internet connectivity to everyday objects and environments promotes ubiquitous access to information and integration with third-party systems. Further, connected “things” can be used as physical interfaces to enable users to cooperate, leveraging multiple devices via parallel and distributed actions. Yet creating prototypes of IoT systems is a complex task for developers non-expert in IoT, as it requires dealing with multi-layered hardware and software infrastructures. We introduce RapIoT, a software toolkit that facilitates the prototyping of IoT systems by providing an integrated set of technologies. Our solution abstracts low-level details and communication protocols, allowing developers non-expert in IoT to focus on application logic, facilitating rapid prototyping. RapIoT supports the development of collaborative applications by enabling the definition of high-level data type primitives and allowing interactions spread among multiple smart objects. RapIoT primitives act as a loosely coupled interface between generic IoT devices and applications, simplifying the development of systems that make use of an ecology of devices distributed to multiple users and environments. We illustrate the potential of our toolkit by presenting the development process of an IoT application ideated during a workshop with non-expert developers and addressing real-world challenges affecting smart cities. We conclude by discussing the strength and limitations of our platform, highlighting further possible uses for collaborative applications."

We formalise a notion of type soundness for the calculus that encompasses the concept of domain alignment, and present a sound static type inference system. This calculus and its type inference system can act as a core for actual implementation of coordination languages and models, as well as to pave the way towards formal analysis of properties concerning expressiveness, self-stabilisation, topology independence, and relationships with the continuous space–time semantics of spatial computations."

The paper presents a framework of novel routing technique in order to jointly address the problem pertaining to routing overhead and energy drainage among the mobile nodes.

This paper proposes a novel application-aware and user-interaction aware energy optimization middleware framework (AURA) for pervasive mobile devices. AURA optimizes CPU and screen backlight energy consumption while maintaining a minimum acceptable level of performance. The proposed framework employs a novel Bayesian application classifier and management strategies based on Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning to achieve energy savings. Real-world user evaluation studies on Google Android based HTC Dream and Google Nexus One smartphones running the AURA framework demonstrate promising results, with up to 29% energy savings compared to the baseline device manager, and up to 5×savings over prior work on CPU and backlight energy co-optimization."

Consequently, further efforts are still required to resolve the issues related to the growing variety of available devices and of accessibility difficulties met by different categories of users. Therefore, in this paper we are introducing a model driven approach that aims to assist local and worldwide communities of developers throughout the development process of accessible user interfaces (UIs) targeting several emerging platforms. Based on a set of models from different abstraction levels followed by transformations, this approach provides a generic framework that integrates accessibility concerns starting from the design time.

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback."

These highly modular architectures have a symmetric and regular structure consisting of two blocks, a multiplication block and an addition/subtraction block. The first architecture utilizes 8 multipliers and 16 adders/subtractors, achieving a maximum clock frequency of 95 MHz. The second architecture utilizes only 4 multipliers and 8 adders/subtractors, achieving a maximum clock frequency of 100 MHz; however it requires additional multiplexers and more clock cycles (from 1 to 58 clock cycles depends on the points) for the computation. As a result, the proposed hardware architectures constitute an efficient choice for area-restricted applications such as embedded or pervasive computing systems."

In this paper, industrial network-based location update is proceeds only in the macro-cell layer which LMA (Local Mobility Area) domain was made from by large macro-cell. An MU (Mobile User) will stay in such the LMA domain for a long time. As a result, location update cost due to the reduced frequency of location update can be reduced. In order to reduce paging delay, when paging load is not high, the paged MU only will be searched in the macro-cell layer. Otherwise, it will be searched at the micro-cell layer which sequential searching method was applied. The operation for the scheme is simple, so the industrial network-based of macro-cell/micro-cell concept can have an advantage because MU can receive signal both overlapped micro-cell and macro-cell. Analytical cost modeling is analyzed and we evaluated delay costs for paging. Numerical results show that the paging delay that a crossing-layer scheme is low occurred in costs low relatively."

These contexts and community structures are complex to mine from data collected in the wild due to the unprecedented growth of data, noise, uncertainties and complexities. Typical existing approaches would first extract the latent patterns to explain human dynamics or behaviors and then use them as a way to consistently formulate numerical representations for community detection, often via a clustering method. While being able to capture high-order and complex representations, these two steps are performed separately. More importantly, they face a fundamental difficulty in determining the correct number of latent patterns and communities. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly addresses these challenges to simultaneously discover latent patterns and communities in a unified Bayesian nonparametric framework. Our Simultaneous Extraction of Context and Community (SECC) model roots in the nested Dirichlet process theory which allows a nested structure to be built to summarize data at multiple levels. We demonstrate our framework on five datasets where the advantages of the proposed approach are validated."

In this paper, we propose an innovative target tracking algorithm which combines learning regression tree approach and filtering methods using RSSI metric. Regression Tree algorithm is investigated in order to estimate the position using the RSSI. This method is combined to filtering approaches yielding to more refined results.

This research area seems to be the next logical step in context-aware computing, which, until a few years ago, had been concerned more with the present and the past temporal dimensions. Most of research works related to context prediction employ the same algorithm for all cases. We did not find any approach that automatically decides the best prediction method according to the situation. Therefore, we propose the ORACON model. ORACON adapts itself in order to apply the best algorithm to the case. This adaptive behavior is the main contribution of this work and differentiates the proposed model of other related works. Furthermore, ORACON supports other important aspects of ubiquitous computing, such as, context formal representation and privacy. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first experiment successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ORACON to support context prediction and privacy aspects. The test used context histories generated with a location database that contains 22 millions chekins across 220,000 users in the location sharing services Foursquare and Twitter. The second experiment assessed the adaptive feature of the ORACON. The test simulated the behavior of 30 users for a period of 30 days, using context histories generated through the Siafu simulator. This tool generates data for the evaluation and the comparison of machine learning methods in mobile context-aware settings. We concluded that ORACON chose the most accurate prediction algorithm in the simulated scenario, proving that the model reached the main contribution sought by this research."

abstract = "As the most critical trading mechanism in supply chain management/operation management fields, Dutch auction theories and practices have been regarded as one of the key teaching subjects of many universities. The advancement of ubiquitous computing technologies has not only solved the technological problems of dealing with millions of simultaneous biddings in real practices, but also enabled students to learn elusive and complex knowledge in an interactive environment. However, little attention was paid to educational discussions and quantitative analyses when applying the ubiquitous learning (u-learning) system in auction classes. This quasi-experimental study was among the first to develop and evaluate a smart u-learning system that integrated Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies to simulate real, authentic auction activities, while detecting learning behaviors of students. We also integrated and utilized the pedagogical approach of Teaching by Examples and Learning by Doing (TELD) in the presented system, which further strengthened dynamic interactions and timely teaching instructions for students. The data analysis showed that this innovative system had positive effects on students’ learning outcomes. The results also revealed that applying the u-learning system in teaching procedural knowledge, rather than conceptual knowledge, was more resource effective and less time consuming. Moreover, students had high perceptions of learning content when the system was designed with efficient pedagogical assistance, interaction flexibility and user-friendly features. Critical practical implications were also summarized for teachers, system designers, researchers, and policymakers."

The delivery of efficiencies and advanced services in a smart grid will require both a comprehensive overlay communications network and flexible software platforms that can process data from a variety of sources, especially electronic sensor networks. Parallel developments in autonomic systems, pervasive computing and context-awareness (relating in particular to data fusion, context modelling, and semantic data) could provide key elements in the development of scalable smart grid data management systems and applications that utilise a multi-technology communications network. This paper describes: (1) the communications and data management requirements of the emerging smart grid, (2) state-of-the-art techniques and systems for context-awareness and (3) a future direction towards devising a context-aware middleware platform for the smart grid, as well as associated requirements and challenges."

Many energy efficiency applications of ubiquitous computing need to access some related contexts to provide the best and adequate energy saving services at the right time and at the right place. One of the big challenges is the difficulty and the complexity to make systems identify and understand situations in the building business, especially in complex situations to provide adequate energy-saving services for each of which. This issue is divided into two parts: On one hand, the smart building and its environment must be modeled in a way that provides context-awareness. On the other hand is the how to effectively exploit this context-awareness to reduce energy consumption and increase the user comfort. In this paper, we propose an intelligent context-awareness Building Energy Management System (ICA-BEMS). ICA-BEMS uses hybrid energy-saving techniques based on a Smart Context-Awareness Management (Smart-CAM). Smart-CAM uses smart building ontology to organize smart building knowledge and utilizes a new context-awareness mechanism to provide contextual information. The former exploits the contextual information in reasoning to reduce the building energy consumption, promoting users behavioral change and maximizing the user's comfort to bring about a better energy efficiency policy. To evaluate our system, we have developed a smart building simulator (Open-SBS) which simulates smart building comportments and human behaviors. We have created various scenarios of daily life in the smart building simulator. We have tested our ICA-BEMS effect on energy consumption having a positive result. Energy consumption has been decreased by 40% of total energy consumption."

abstract = "In several domains, including healthcare and home automation, it is important to unobtrusively monitor the activities of daily living (ADLs) carried out by people at home. A popular approach consists in the use of sensors attached to everyday objects to capture user interaction, and ADL models to recognize the current activity based on the temporal sequence of used objects. Often, ADL models are automatically extracted from labeled datasets of activities and sensor events, using supervised learning techniques. Unfortunately, acquiring such datasets in smart homes is expensive and violates users’ privacy. Hence, an alternative solution consists in manually defining ADL models based on common sense, exploiting logic languages such as description logics. However, manual specification of ADL ontologies is cumbersome, and rigid ontological definitions fail to capture the variability of activity execution. In this paper, we introduce a radically new approach enabled by the recent proliferation of tagged visual contents available on the Web. Indeed, thanks to the popularity of social network applications, people increasingly share pictures and videos taken during the execution of every kind of activity. Often, shared contents are tagged with metadata, manually specified by their owners, that concisely describe the depicted activity. Those metadata represent an implicit activity label of the picture or video. Moreover, today’s computer vision tools support accurate extraction of tags describing the situation and the objects that appear in the visual content. By reasoning with those tags and their corresponding activity labels, we can reconstruct accurate models of a comprehensive set of human activities executed in the most disparate situations. This approach overcomes the main shortcomings of existing techniques. Compared to supervised learning methods, it does not require the acquisition of training sets of sensor events and activities. Compared to knowledge-based methods, it does not involve any manual modeling effort, and it captures a comprehensive array of execution modalities. Through extensive experiments with large datasets of real-world ADLs, we show that this approach is practical and effective."

Mobile ad-hoc networks are mainly formed by mobile users, which can belong to different trust domains, in order to leverage the wealth of pervasive resources and available capabilities. The use of digital certificates is suitable for pervasive networking because of its decentralized and dynamic nature. Nevertheless, the validation of such certificates can become a more complex and costly process than it is in fixed-infrastructure networks. This is because pervasive networks face challenges such as environments that change with a certain degree of randomness, ad-hoc interactions with foreign devices, temporal disconnections that make it difficult to access updated and required information, and limited devices running costly processes. For these reasons, we propose a user-centric architecture that extends the validation of digital certificates in an adaptive way. The main contribution consists of a decision engine that takes advantage of the specific local and external resources in an opportunistic fashion. The solution preserves the security level required for each application and the resource consumption of the user device."

We evaluate this algorithm on real-world smart home datasets and provide evidence that our proposed approach is most effective at predicting activity timings."

Human–computer interaction, like any vocational discipline, sits upon three broad foundations: theoretical principles, professional practice and a community of people. As an interdisciplinary field the theoretical roots of HCI encompass a number of other disciplines including psychology, computing, ergonomics, and social sciences; however, it also has theoretical and practical challenges of its own. The evolving internal and external context of HCI, computers, have become smaller and less costly; this has led to changes in nature of the users and uses of computers, with corresponding impact on society. The paper explores the current challenges of computers from the cloud to digital fabrication and the need to design for solitude. It suggests that HCI should not just react to the changes around it, but also shape those changes."

We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics."

abstract = "Recent trends such as the Internet of Things and pervasive computing demand for novel engineering approaches able to support the specification and scalable runtime execution of adaptive behaviour for large collections of interacting devices. Aggregate Computing is one such approach, formally founded in the field calculus, which enables programming of device aggregates by a global stance, through functional composition of self-organisation patterns that is turned automatically into repetitive local computations and gossip-like interactions. However, the logically decentralised and open nature of such algorithms and systems presumes a fundamental cooperation of the devices involved: an error in a device or a focused attack may significantly compromise the computation outcome and hence the algorithms built on top. For this reason, in this paper, we move the first steps towards attack-resistant aggregate computations. We propose trust as a framework to detect, ponder or isolate voluntary/involuntary misbehaviours, with the goal of mitigating the influence on the overall computation. On top of this, we consider recommendations in order to provide more reactivity and stability through the sharing of individual perceptions. To better understand the fragility of aggregate systems in face of attacks and investigate the extent of the mitigation afforded by the adoption of trust mechanisms, we consider the paradigmatic case of the gradient algorithm. Experiments are carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the adopted trust framework to malevolent actions and to study the impact of different factors on the error committed by trust-based gradients under attack. Finally, in a case study of the spatial channel algorithm, it is shown how the protection afforded by attack-resistant gradients can be effectively propagated to higher-level building blocks."

abstract = "Human attention has bottlenecked today’s ubiquitous computing environment where users are consuming increasing amounts of information from numerous applications and services. Since the system-to-user provision of information is becoming more proactive, mainly via push notifications that often cause interruption at the users’ side, attention management is becoming very important. Despite the many existing studies concerned with detecting opportune moments to present such push information to the users (in a way that preserves the user’s attention and lowers their cognitive load and frustration), there is little evaluation of such systems in the real-world production environments. Overlooked areas of study also include the examination of real users and notification contents. In this paper, we present various results from the first extensive evaluation on user’s interruptibility and engagement in the real-world environment with a market-leading smartphone application that boasts a large number of users, including real notification content on the application. Following our previous mobile-sensing and machine learning-based interruptibility estimation approach, which was an effective study in its own right (Okoshi et al., 2015 [18,19]), we embedded a logic with the same approach in the “Yahoo! JAPAN” Android app (one of the most popular applications on the national market). The results from our large-scale in-the-wild user study (that included more than 680,000 users and spanned three weeks) indicate that, in most cases, delaying the notification delivery until an interruptible moment is detected is beneficial to users. The practice results in significant reduction of user response time (49.7%) when compared to delivering the notifications immediately. We observed a higher number of notifications opened in our system and constant improvement in user engagement levels throughout the entire study period. We also observed differences in click rates among different days and time among users with different attributes (e.g., age, gender, and occupation). Additional evaluation of our revised system, which can train and distribute different models for weekdays and weekends, improved the click rates during weekends. This negated the performance degradation previously observed during weekends."

abstract = "Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) is a critical issue of emergency medical service (EMS). In addition to the first aids given to OHCA patients by witnesses or bystanders, time factors such as arrival of ambulance and transportation from site to EMS are also important. Comprehensive coverage of EMS, especially enhanced by ubiquitous computing technologies, could significantly improve the survival rate of OHCA patients. However, it heavily challenges the resource allocation and management policy in the public health system of a metropolis.
Objectives
In this study, we first used spatial analysis techniques with a finer granularity to identify high risk areas of OHCA in a metropolis. We then used data mining techniques to elucidate the effects of patients’ characteristics, pre-hospital resuscitation treatments, and spatial factors on post-OHCA survivability. With this information, public health institutions can enhance the EMS by allocating properly first-aid resources at the right places to improve the survival rate of OHCA patients.
Methods
We used New Taipei City, Taiwan as the scope of this study. Data of all registered OHCA cases in New Taipei City in 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. The dataset was combined with the National Doorplate Database to enhance the granularity of spatial analyses. Global and local spatial analyses based on Global Moran’s Index, Local Moran’s Index, and Getis-Ord Gi* statistic were performed to cluster high risk districts for OHCA in New Taipei City. Statistical methods such as Chi-square test, logistic regression, and decision tree were then adopted to analyze factors influencing 2-h survivability after OHCA.
Results
Significant spatial clustering of OHCA events was found (p<0.05) in the western side of New Taipei City. We found that the 2-h survival rate after OHCA was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with type of OHCA, EMT-P (Emergency Medical Technicians-Paramedic) dispatch, intubation, drug administration, onsite ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation), AED (Automated External Defibrillator) usage, bystander witnessing, AED initial cardiac rhythm, cardiac rhythm recovery before admission, and past histories of diabetes and renal disease.
Conclusions
Based on the finding of this study, several important factors of OHCA can be improved to enhance the quality of the EMS service. With the spatial analysis of OHCA hotspots, public health institutions can manage the first-aid resources more efficiently and make EMS policies more effectively. As a result, the survival rate of OHCA patients can be improved."

In this context, we present a real world data set that has been collected from 15 participants for 8 common activities where they carried 7 wearable devices in different on-body positions. Our results show that the detection of the device position consistently improves the result of activity recognition for common activities. Regarding cross-subjects models, we identified the waist as the most suitable device location at which the acceleration patterns for the same activity across several people are most similar. In this context, our results provide evidence for the reliability of physical characteristics based cross-subjects models."

Unbalanced energy consumption is an inherent problem in WSNs, characterized by multi-hop routing and a many-to-one traffic pattern. This uneven energy dissipation can significantly reduce network lifetime. In multi-hop sensor networks, information obtained by the monitoring nodes need to be routed to the sinks, the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node. In an energy-aware routing approach, most proposed algorithms aim at minimizing the total energy consumption or maximizing network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a novel energy aware hierarchical cluster-based (NEAHC) routing protocol with two goals: minimizing the total energy consumption and ensuring fairness of energy consumption between nodes. We model the relay node choosing problem as a nonlinear programming problem and use the property of convex function to find the optimal solution. We also evaluate the proposed algorithm via simulations at the end of this paper."

In this use case, which uses UN's New Urban Agenda (NUA) as exemplifying model, we show the benefits of using blockchain in the urban field and we do so by breaking down the NUA in policies, planning, regulations and standards and dissecting these further into Quito's Implementation Plan (QIP) themes and scopes. Use case results confirm that blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context. Blockchain is here to take on and be the next network for cities."

In this work, Naive Bayes (NB), is revisited by looking at heuristic ways of improving any skewed data bias, systematic and weighted magnitude errors; to address the problem of human activity recognition and propose the Improved Naive Bayesian Algorithm. The novelty of this work is in adjusting the human activity recognition problem as a special case of text classification."

The proposed work includes a novel approach to symmetric-key based verifiable proxy encryption to make the exchange delegation flexible, efficient and simple to implement on resource-limited devices commonly used in u-commerce systems. This approach is then applied to design a new exchange protocol. An analysis of the protocol is also provided to confirm its security and fairness.

In this perspective, this work presents a model, named SSN, based on the concept of Spontaneous Social Network, which allows the interaction of people anywhere and anytime without the need of any preexisting relation. The main scientific contribution of the SSN model is the possibility of creating social communities based on a combination of multiple contexts, including location, profile and data obtained from external online social networks. In this way, SSN focus on suggesting communities that users are interested in. In the process of developing the model, we propose a methodology for building semantic-based recommendation systems. In terms of evaluation, we performed two experiments using a developed mobile application called Dino. First, we presented hypothetical scenarios based on possible real-world SSN applications to measure users’ perceived sense of community. Second, we asked users to consider their real interests in suggested groups. We computed average values of 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall, respectively. The experiments’ results to assess the proposed scenarios ascertain average values of agreement above 80% for sense of community, belonging, social usefulness, member loyalty, and communities’ ephemerality. Therefore, our evaluation depicts that dynamic virtual communities formed by a SSN model based application would beneficially improve a social-aware virtual environment."

Compared to those who could not rely on technology, participants who used their smartphones found the building more easily but ended up feeling less socially connected. Although having access to smartphones improved participants’ mood by making their task easier, this beneficial effect was diminished by the costs to social connection. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that the benefits of pervasive connectivity may be undercut when technology supplants social interactions."

abstract = "Animals communicate with each other via varieties of signal modalities such as visual, acoustic, semiochemicals, gestural, or communication behavior. Although animal communication has been studied as a signaler-receiver dyadic system until recently, it is actually a complex network due to the ubiquitous existence of third-party receivers in their signaling space, such as eavesdroppers, bystanders, and audiences. A question of fundamental importance in both science and humanity is whether or not animal signals are honest or deceitful (i.e., communication reliability) since it may shed light on the study of trust and altruism in human beings. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, the state-of-the-art research in animal communication (dyadic paradigm) and animal communication networks (network paradigm) and their potential inspiration for secure, resilient and pervasive computing are reviewed. Secondly, by arguing that competition, cooperation and communication are the three fundamental elements that natural selection acts upon in the evolution of organisms, and by comparing the study of cooperation (such as formulated as the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game), with the study of animal communication (such as formulated with Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) game), it is suggested that the latter field may spawn important cross-disciplinary research with the potential influence similar to or beyond that generated by the PD game research. The paper also summarizes the recent extension to evolutionary game theory (EGT) with survival analysis and dynamic hybrid fault models by the author. Finally, seven open questions, with regard to animal communication inspired computing and communication, primarily from the interdisciplinary perspective are posed. As a side note, this is the second article of a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication. Given the extensive scope of behavior biology, I only focus on two fields most relevant to computing and communication animal cognition (part one, Ma, 2014) and communication (this article). The previous part one reviewed animal-cognition inspired computing; part one also presented an overview of the behavior biology inspired computing. This part two is focused on animal communication; the relationship between cognition and communication is mainly discussed in this part also."

Previous studies have focused on the physical capability and capacity of the communication technologies, but the equally important development of suitable and efficient semantic content for transmission received notably less attention. Ontology is one promising approach for context modelling in ubiquitous computing environments, and in the transport domain it can be used both for context modelling and semantic contents for vehicular communications. This paper explores the development of an ontological model implementing relative geo-semantic information messages to support vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The proposed ontology model contains classes, objects, their properties/relations as well as some functions and query templates to represent and update the information of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle interactions and behaviour. This model was developed through a scenario enabling the evaluation of traffic conflict resolution approaches, by implementing a set of decision-making processes for intelligent vehicles. Given the scope of the proposed ontology modelling, it shows how vehicular communications can be used to update each vehicle’s context model. This work can be easily extended for more complex interactions among vehicles and the infrastructure."

ABSTRACT
The pervasive computing is one of the characteristics of the information society, which provides greater diversity and availability in offering collections of data and information. Currently the informational problem is not the lack of data and information, but its excess, which makes complex and lengthy process of analysis of the quality and selection of digital content, is such contents in databases or information repositories. Aiming to improve this process, this paper proposes an artifact that makes the analysis of the quality of digital collections. This artifact is innovative by direct actions on the basis of priorities and considers specific databases and information repositories aspects. The research is qualitative and applied the technique of group discussion, covering the initial stages of the design science research (DSR), phases associated with the design and the affordance of an artifact of a scientific nature. Five researchers were trained in the use of the artifact, which used it to analyze five collections associated with micro and small Brazilian companies, being three data available in the database and two data available at information repositories. The proposed device was evaluated using a scale of opinions and attitudes. The processes of research contributed to the evolution of the artifact, identifying and implementing improvement points that made the most functional artifact according to its users and more suitable for the next stage of DSR, which implies the utility test."

In this paper, a clustering-based and QoS-aware services composition algorithm (CQCA) is proposed. To increase the composition optimality and reduce the composition time, the candidate services are first partitioned into clusters, where each cluster represents a QoS level. In addition, a new formulation of the utility function based on the use of the characteristics of the resulting clusters is proposed to remove unpromising candidate services in terms of QoS. A lexicographic optimization method is then exploited to filter out candidate services that have low QoS attributes values. Finally, a search tree is constructed to find near-to-optimal compositions. The obtained performance shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms other composition approaches by finding very near-to-optimal compositions in a reduced composition time."

This situation challenges the viability of health and social services. Smart home technology can play a significant role in easing the pressure on caregivers, as well as reduce the financial costs of health and social services. Activity of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an essential step to translate sensor data into activities at high semantic levels. Supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are the most commonly used techniques for this application. However, a common problem is a lack of availability of enough annotated data to train these algorithms. Collecting annotated data is expensive, time consuming, and may violate people’s privacy. Intra- and inter-personal variation in performing complex activities is another challenge for an ML-based activity recognition approach. In this paper, a multi-layered knowledge-based architecture for recognising ADL in real-time is proposed. At the first stage, sensor data is pre-processed; events that describe changes in the environment are detected at the second stage, in which the sequence of events is used to recognise more semantically complex activities at the third stage. A new ADL ontology is proposed to model the knowledge related to the sensor platform and the targeted activities as the previously proposed ontologies were either designed to deal with specific sensor data, or they ignored the context environment information which is important in recognising complex activities."

In this framework, several supervised machine learning algorithms are tested on the labeled datasets and the algorithm which outperforms others is selected. Two types of sensing devices were utilized for analyses: wearable devices worn around the neck by the test subjects, and a network of stationary devices located in the test subjects' working indoor spaces. 221 employees of federal agencies housed in facilities managed by the US. General Services Administration in the mid-Atlantic and Southern states participated in this study, answering questions about their current task every hour. Overall accuracies were observed of 86.72% for wearable and stationary devices, 81.25% for only wearable-only, and 85.16% for stationary-only for prediction of the mixed multi-label classification via Random Forests algorithm. The high prediction allows for identifying subjects’ tasks when training labels are not available. Predicting occupants’ interactions as a main indicator of occupants’ behavior have significant implications for the energy efficiency of building systems (up to 20% savings)."

The results confirmed the overall effect of ubiquitous media systems dependency on individuals’ reasoned continuance usage decision. The findings suggest that the level of dependency towards a UMS raises the perceived positive attributes about the system: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; as well as the cognitive appraisal about the discrepancies between initial expectations and post-use performance."

abstract = "In last years, the Internet of Things has been a revolution in terms of applications and research. Currently, there are a great variety of nodes connected to each other to create different applications in areas, ranging from sport to business, inter alia. These applications compromise our private information about our bank accounts, health, and location. This makes us take safety measures to achieve a secure communication, where the interception of a message by a malicious user cannot compromise our privacy. This security encompasses a very broad concept that can be addressed in multiple ways. This work focuses on the techniques and cryptographic algorithms that can be used in the messages exchanged among the nodes to create secure Internet of Things networks in a way to protect our communications. In this article, we have used the Midgar platform to evaluate the different possibilities of traditional security techniques related to cryptography with the purpose of testing the different combinations to find a solution for the Internet of Things when it uses insecure protocols. Analysing the results to determine the best solution, in terms of costs and security, we concluded that the use the RSA, AES and SHA-3 algorithms are a real possibility to protect message privacy among smart objects. This combination offers the lowest consumption–security relation among all the combinations that we have tested in our evaluation."

abstract = "The last few years of the twentieth century witnessed the emerging convergence of biology and computer science and this trend has been accelerating since then. The study of animal behavior or behavior biology has been one of the major contributors for this convergence. Behavior is fascinating because it is the response of an organism to internal and external signals and it is controlled by complex interactions among nerves, the sensory and the motor systems. To some extent, behavior is similar to the output (or response) of a computer system or a network node if we consider an animal brain as a computer node. This paper is the first in a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication, with the first part focusing on animal cognition and the second part on animal communication (Ma, 2014). The present article also assumes the task of presenting a general introduction on behavior biology literature, which sets a foundation for synthesizing both parts of the series but the synthesis will be performed in the second part of the series. I sets three objectives in this ‘cognition’ part: (i) to present a brief overview on the literature of behavior biology for computer scientists; (ii) to summarize the state-of-the-art studies in several cognitive aspects of animal behavior: focusing on emerging research in cognitive ecology, social learning and innovation, as well as animal logics; (iii) to review some important existing studies inspired by animal behavior and further present a perspective on the future research. These cognition-related topics offer insights for research fields such as machine learning, human computer interactions (HCI), brain computer interfaces (BCIs), evolutionary computing, pervasive computing, etc. In perspective, I suggest that the interaction between behavioral biology and computer science should be bidirectional, and a new subject, behavioral informatics, or more general computational behavior biology, should be developed by the cooperative efforts between biologists and computer scientists."

The main idea of the Naked world is that all the services which are currently provided by gadgets will be provided by the infrastructure, thus no gadgets will be needed to use any kind of digital services. When a user in the Naked world intends to use a service, the infrastructure senses the user, the nearby intelligent surrounding launches an interactive user interface, performs identification through biometric identities, provides the service, and then closes the session when the user finishes the job. Therefore, the Naked world comprises highly intelligent and context-aware interactive environments. The vision of the Naked world is an evolution towards a user-friendly and ubiquitously available digital services, which is naturally bounded by the technological advancement. Henceforth, this paper presents the essential technologies and functional requirements along with the current and forthcoming novel technological concepts and challenges for the realization of the Naked world."

An updated mechanism of the dynamic tag keys is introduced and a self-synchronized scheme is designed in the protocol, which has achieved the second verification for the tags. The security of the protocol is verified and analyzed by the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the attack models, moreover it has been compared with the existing schemes of security properties and its storage and computational performance. The results show that the proposed protocol has the ability to considerably reduce the amount of computation between tags and back-end database, and enhance the search efficiency of the whole system without the additional cost of the tags. It can satisfy safe requirements of RFID system effectively, also improve the authentication efficiency. The proposed protocol is more suitable for the low cost RFID system."

Most importantly, widely used indoor semantics, such as stairs, escalators, elevators and doors, are also automatically detected and annotated to the constructed maps in the same inference process. Since the final inferred maps provide locations of the different indoor semantics together with localization database, Zeus enables real-time location-based semantic queries. The evaluation result shows that Zeus accurately infers semantic-annotated indoor maps, and provide accurate semantic query in different indoor environments."

However, fairly little attention has been devoted to the design of ubiquitous computing approaches for spontaneous exploration of large information spaces enabling co-located collaboration. We investigate whether an entity-based user interface provides a solution to support co-located search on heterogeneous devices. We present the design and implementation of QueryTogether, a multi-device collaborative search tool through which entities such as people, documents, and keywords can be used to compose queries that can be shared to a public screen or specific users with easy touch enabled interaction. We conducted mixed-methods user experiments with twenty seven participants (nine groups of three people), to compare the collaborative search with QueryTogether to a baseline adopting established search and collaboration interfaces. Results show that QueryTogether led to more balanced contribution and search engagement. While the overall s-recall in search was similar, in the QueryTogether condition participants found most of the relevant results earlier in the tasks, and for more than half of the queries avoided text entry by manipulating recommended entities. The video analysis demonstrated a more consistent common ground through increased attention to the common screen, and more transitions between collaboration styles. Therefore, this provided a better fit for the spontaneity of ubiquitous scenarios. QueryTogether and the corresponding study demonstrate the importance of entity based interfaces to improve collaboration by facilitating balanced participation, flexibility of collaboration styles and social processing of search entities across conversation and devices. The findings promote a vision of collaborative search support in spontaneous and ubiquitous multi-device settings, and better linking of conversation objects to searchable entities."

Simulations and experiments using a real WSN testbed, were performed to validate our protocol.

They have been successfully used in several areas, such as business process management, human computer interaction, and pervasive computing. Within these areas, context adaptivity has recently emerged as a new challenge to explicitly address fitness between system behavior and its execution context. However, the existing PN formalisms do not provide reliable modeling, simulation, and verification techniques that can accurately consider the system’s execution context and adapt to it in order to reflect the system execution reality. This paper addresses this problem by presenting context-adaptive Petri nets (CAPNs), a formalism that allows the modeling of context-adaptive behavior by integrating the powerful modeling and analysis techniques of PNs with very expressive context data management techniques. The formalism is supported by a tool that allows its modeling, simulation, and verification. The contributions have been validated using a case-based evaluation showing very promising results. CAPNs will allow organizations to accurately describe, enact, and analyze the behavior of their dynamic systems in a more reliable and realistic way, allowing them to leverage more informed decisions, to make better use of their resources, and to increase therefore their competitiveness."

Connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to increase safety and reduce traffic congestion. Once all the vehicles are connected and geo-localized there might still be a need to integrate a different level of autonomous vehicles on the road: from the human driven vehicle to the fully autonomous vehicle. While surrogate safety measures have been extensively considered to estimate the risk of accidents due to improper driving, there has been no attempt to use them to help drivers achieve a better driving style. This paper presents an experimentation on the idea to warn drivers when they are driving in such a way (owing to their interactions with other vehicles) that could potentially lead to an accident. In the proposed system the driver is warned of the risk of collision by the combined use of localization (GPS) gathered information and the application of road safety indicators such as Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash, Time To Collision and others. The experimentation involving car-following vehicles showed the feasibility, with existing technologies, of using surrogate measures of safety to assist the driver in keeping a better driving trajectory. Once connected vehicles are introduced on the market, the presented results can be a base to develop commercial smartphone applications that will allow users of "not connected" old vehicles to also take advantage of real time driving assistance for a safer use of the road."

In PS, a human user explicitly performs the tasks of sensing and reporting, typically in lieu of incentives. One major limitation with PS is the sparsity of data owing to the lack of active participation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the research community. In our preliminary work (Barnwal et al., 2018), we propose a spatio-temporal event occurrence and report generation based data simulation framework called PS-Sim. This paper extends the PS-Sim framework with a novel budget allocation mechanism for incentivizing participants. The allocation mechanism guarantees the presence of a threshold number of active participants and also ensures the reporting of the significant fraction of events for sustainability of PS applications. The simulation environment provided by the PS-Sim framework replicates real participation and event occurrence behaviors, which is expected to enable the domain experts to investigate and assess the requisites (benefits and challenges) of introducing smart city applications. As a part of the evaluation of the budget allocation mechanism, we study its performance under varying effects of reward and participation, and establish its fairness as far as the remuneration of active participants is concerned."

In the literature, most reasoning approaches for HAR are based on centralized approach where a central system is responsible for processing and reasoning about sensor data in order to recognize activities. Since sensor data are distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic (i.e., whose characteristics are varying over time) in the smart home, reasoning process on these data for HAR needs to be distributed over a group of heterogeneous, autonomous and interacting entities in order to be more efficient. This paper proposes a main contribution, the DCR approach, a fully Distributed Collaborative Reasoning multi-agent approach where agents, with diverse classifiers, observe sensor data, make local predictions, communicate and collaborate to identify current activities. Then, an improved version of the DCR approach is proposed, the DCR-OL approach, a distributed Online Learning approach where learning agents learns from their collaborations to improve their own performance in activity recognition.

The delay incurred due to IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS) re-registration and session re-setup process during vertical handoff (VHO) is still a major bottleneck for Voice Over IP (VoIP) and interactive multimedia services. In the conventional Session initiation Protocol (SIP), handoff performance is very poor due to high handoff delay and packet loss. In this paper, we propose two SIP based schemes, a Context Awareness (CA)-based Pre-registration approach to reduce the IMS Re-registration delay and a novel scheme called Prior-SIP (P-SIP) with a cross layer scheme utilizing Media Independent Handover (MIH) services to reduce the IMS session re-setup delay in a WiFi/WiMax heterogeneous environment by defining new SIP messages. We have simulated these scenarios using NS2 and the performance characteristics are studied. We have also analyzed the IMS pre-registration delay and IMS session re-setup delay based on Queuing theory. The simulation and analytical results show that, the proposed solution shows an improvement of 44% in terms of handoff delay and packet loss when compared with previous approaches and was able to maintain 90% throughput during handoff and suits well for supporting real-time applications to mobile users."

In this paper, we present a reliability-aware energy management (RAEM) scheme for reducing the energy consumption for weakly hard real-time systems with (m, k)-constraints, which requires that at least m out of any k consecutive jobs of a task meet their deadlines. In order to ensure the (m, k)-constraints while preserving the system reliability, we propose to partition the real-time jobs into mandatory and optional ones as well as to reserve recovery space for mandatory ones in an adaptive way. Moreover, efficient on-line scheduling techniques are proposed to reduce the system-wide energy, which is consumed not only by the processor but also by other peripheral devices at run-time. Through extensive simulations, our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed techniques can significantly outperform the previous research in reducing system-wide energy consumption for weakly hard real-time systems while preserving the system reliability."

In application, a highly flexible and PVDF fibers based sensor is integrated with printed circuit board (PCB) substrates. The proposed self-powered sensor exhibits lightweight, low cost, easily scale-up production and high stability. By using a sequentially deposited the three-dimensional structures for the enhancement of power generating capability, the PCB-based self-powered sensor (PSS) can be directly applied to make smart gloves for human–machine interfaces (HMI) of wirelessly controlled machines."

Generally, the assistance tools are mainly dedicated to the management board and fewer initiatives focus on the operational needs of the worker at the shop-floor level. This paper proposes a context-aware knowledge-based system dedicated to support the actors of the factory by the right information at the right time and in the appropriate format regarding their context of work and level of expertise. Particularly, specific assistance functionalities are dedicated to the workers in charge of the machine configuration and the realization of manufacturing operations. PGD-based (Proper Generalized Decomposition) algorithms are used for real time simulation of industrial processes and machine configuration. At the conceptual level, a semantic model is proposedas key enablersfor the structuration of the knowledge-based system."

This problem is even more significant in the business environments, where effectively the time we take to finish some kind of task can mean profit or loss for the business. The key to these problems can be in the adaptation of the interface to user needs and constrains as it happens in solutions for situational induced impairment and disabilities (SIID). This can be made by inference the context in which the user it is by using different sensors available on mobile platform and different sources of information such as user profile, agenda and usage history.

There are various kinds of data processing techniques such as compression or coding to improve the transmission efficiency for heterogeneous networks with different requirements. However, the methods for improving fault tolerance in ubiquitous communication systems are still lacked especially for the multimedia data driven applications at the execution ends. In this paper, we propose an image content recovery method for JPEG images that can recover the image content by estimating the DC coefficients without any pre-know knowledge. This method can also be used to transmit the rough image content by reducing the data amount needed to be transmitted. Thus, fault tolerance can be achieved at the receivers’ ends for ubiquitous communication systems. The result analysis with different images compared with previous works proved the effectiveness of our method."

The procedure of user-centered design (UCD) was applied during the development. Firstly, player requirements were surveyed and analyzed. And then we determined which functions of RFID could be augmented into the traditional tabletop game, making the game different and more enjoyable. After that, specific game rules and a low fidelity prototype were designed for a usability evaluation, in which six experienced players were invited to do the heuristic evaluation. Finally, a high fidelity prototype was implemented, including game board, control panel, game pieces, graphical/audio output device and data process center, based on the improvements of low fidelity prototype."

abstract = "Recognising human activities from sensors embedded in an environment or worn on bodies is an important and challenging research topic in pervasive computing. Existing work on activity recognition is mainly concerned with identifying single user sequential activities from well-scripted or pre-segmented sequences of sensor events. However a real-world environment often contains multiple users, with each performing activities simultaneously, in their own way and with no explicit instructions to follow. Recognising multi-user concurrent activities is challenging, but essential for designing applications for real environments. This paper presents a novel Knowledge-driven approach for Concurrent Activity Recognition (KCAR). Within KCAR, we explore the semantics underlying each sensor event and use semantic dissimilarity to segment a continuous sensor sequence into fragments, each of which corresponds to one ongoing activity. We exploit the Pyramid Match Kernel, with a strength in approximate matching on hierarchical concepts, to recognise activities of varying grained constraints from a potentially noisy sensor sequence. We conduct an empirical evaluation on a large-scale real-world data set that is collected over one year and consists of 2.8 millions of sensor events. Our results demonstrate that KCAR achieves an average recognition accuracy of 91%."

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach."

In the case of multi-player, open world gaming, in fact even in “old-school” single players games, it is evident the need for adding new features in a game depending on users comments and needs. However this is a challenging task that usually requires considerable design and programming efforts, and more and more patches to games, with the inevitable consequence of loosing interest in the game by players over years. This is particularly a hard problem for all games that do not intend to be designed as interactive novels. Process Content Generation (PCG) of new contents could be a solution to this problem, but usually such techniques are used to design new maps or graphical contents. Here we propose a novel PCG technique able to introduce new contents in games by means of new story-lines and quests. We introduce new intelligent agents and events in the world: their attitudes and behaviors will promote new actions in the game, leading to the involvement of players in new gaming content. The whole methodology is driven by Social Media Analysis contents about the game, and by the use of formal planning techniques based on Multi-Agents models."

In fact, innovative mobile technologies provide new tools (apps) which are able to separate the moment of purchase from the moment of effective consumption, by allowing consumers to make purchases by mobile phone and collect them at home or at a store (a pick-up boutique or collection point), in addition to the traditional in-store service (purchase in the store and collect/consume in the store). The aim of this paper is to understand the extent to which mobile technologies have an impact on consumer behaviour, with emphasis on the drivers motivating consumers to adopt the consumer experience of mobile shopping. To achieve this goal we used a qualitative approach involving 29 consumers in the Italian market, where mobile shopping is still at an early stage. The findings shed a light on the extent to which consumers are moving from e-channels to mobile channels and take into account the effect of these technological innovations in retail settings from a cognitive standpoint, where studies are limited. The implications for researchers and practitioners are then discussed, with emphasis on retailers need to develop new mobile service competences, and integrate and synthetize physical retail settings with mobile opportunities and functionalities."

Trails are historical records of users’ displacements that can be used to develop strategic accessibility solutions, such as security management and recommendation through inferences on behavior. TrailCare contributions are the indoor/outdoor trail-aware strategy and its application to recommend contextualized accessibility resources. The system was implemented and integrated with a motorized wheelchair manufactured by a Brazilian company. The prototype is a complete and functional system based on one of the most used wheelchair models in Brazil. TrailCare was assessed through three practical experiments involving scenarios in a university campus. The first two experiments aimed to evaluate the system functionalities. They consisted of two scenarios that tested practical situations supported by the technologies of context awareness and indoor/outdoor trail awareness. The third experiment focused on evaluating the user experience with the system. It comprised a scenario that was followed by 10 wheelchair users, who were observed by researchers regarding usability aspects. The users also filled out a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The survey was composed by 10 sentences and the results of each one are discussed. The experiments allowed us to learn 10 relevant lessons about technological and usability aspects of the TrailCare that are recorded in this article. The results also showed 96% of acceptance regarding perceived ease of use and 98% in perceived usefulness. The results of experiments showed the potential for implementing TrailCare in real-life situations, allowing the use of ubiquitous technologies to support accessibility for wheelchair users."

We first build a dictionary of time series patterns, called shapelets, to represent atomic activities, then present three shapelet-based models to recognize sequential, concurrent, and generic complex activities. We use the datasets collected from three different labs to evaluate our shapelet-based approach and the results show that our approach can handle complex activity recognition effectively. Our experimental results also show that the shapelet-based approach outperforms other competing approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and system usage."

A systematic literature review identified four key privacy themes that represent issues related to the collection of individuals' data through the IoT: unauthorised surveillance, uncontrolled data generation and use, inadequate authentication and information security risks. These four themes are used to critically analyse the Australian Privacy Principle's (APPs) protection of individual data. Findings indicate that (1) the APPs do not adequately protect individual privacy of data collected through the IoT, and (2) future privacy legislation must consider the implications of global reach of IoT services, and ubiquity and security of IoT data collection with respect to individual privacy."

abstract = "Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it."

Actuators are controllable air conditioners with multiple outlets. Users may be located in any places in the environment. We consider two user satisfaction models: binary and continuous. Based on these assumptions, we present models and control mechanisms to adjust air conditioners to meet users’ requirements. Simulation results show that our mechanisms can indeed achieve our goals in an efficient way."

Moreover, the stream of data communication through WSNs is continuously increasing in volume. Such huge amounts of data are targeted by attackers frequently, and thus it is crucial to provide high-level security to ensure safe and effective communication of information through the Internet. In order to secure data communication over the Internet through WSNs, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) must be provided as an essential component in networks, databases and cloud systems. Over the previous decade, various approaches were utilized for developing IDSs. Unfortunately, however,none of these systems are completely flawless due to uncertainty surrounding network traffic created by normal users and attackers. Hence, the need to develop efficient IDSs has increased continuously. The present study proposes an adaptive IDS based on Fuzzy Rough sets for attribute selection and Allen’s interval algebra, which is applied on network trace datasets in order to select a huge number of attack data for effective prediction of attacks in WSNs. In addition, a fuzzy and rough set based nearest neighborhood algorithm (FRNN) is proposed in this article for effective classification of network trace dataset. This model uses a biased dataset that has 50:50 normal and attack data as opposed to the conventional datasets that have 80:20 normal and attack data. The efficiency of the proposed IDS is increased due to the use of biased data. The combination of feature selection, temporal-based dataset selection, and classification using a biased dataset reduces the false alarm rate and increases detection accuracy."

In the world of ubiquitous computing, fuzzy logic has been emerged as an important research area in the field of face recognition (FR) applications. In this paper, a new efficient and advanced method; inspired from interval type-II fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy logic is proposed. The motivation behind our method is to exploit the benefit of an extended interval type-II membership function: a new concept to fuzzy logics; in collaboration with kernel based sparse representation for FR. To integrate all the pluton, we propose a method called: extended interval type-II and kernel based sparse representation method (ExIntTy2KBSRM). In our proposed method, first we figure out the measure of participation of individual pixels in identifying face images using a variant of Interval type-II fuzzy logic i.e. extended interval type-II membership function in place of type 1 fuzzy logic. Next, we calculate K nearest neighbor to training specimens using simple Euclidean distance metric for sparse representation of each test specimen as a combinatorial of calculated K nearest training specimens. After this, we do classification based on contribution made by calculated train specimens in representation results. The efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed method is shown based on experiments performed on various standard databases. The experimental results show that our method deal with challenges of face recognition more efficiently as compared to other state of art methods, as it integrates the pluton of two different membership function based extended interval type-II fuzzy logics in collaboration with kernel sparse representation. Also, our experimental analysis tells that our proposed method improves the classification accuracy to 2–10% greater than the other existing relevant methods. Impact and significance of the proposed method: The main impact of the proposed method in FR based expert and intelligent systems is that, it considers unseen information available in pixel values of a face image present due to non-linear variations and overlapping of pixels. It also contains the advantage of spatial similar structure information present in face images. This makes the system more effective and efficient in processing face images for FR. Our method also works where Gaussian membership function does not work and discretizes linear and non-linear functions appropriately. Thus, the proposed method is universally applicable to solve more challenges of FR viz. illumination, occlusion, expression etc. and also has application in other areas viz. medical image processing, decision making problems, hand written words recognition, speech processing, watermarking etc. Also, our method makes FR systems computationally more efficient and cost effective by using sparse concept to matrices, which makes system to consume less memory and process data faster."

Given numerous predictions that we will have billions of such devices deployed in the next five years, we have the opportunity to utilize such IoT devices in converting our physical environment into interactive, smart, and intelligent computing infrastructures. In this paper, we present Aura – a highly localized IoT based cloud computing model. Aura allows mobile clients to create ad hoc and flexible clouds using the IoT and other computing devices in the nearby physical environment. Aura provides localized computational capability from untapped computing resources using a task-offloading model for mobile devices. Computations done in Aura are highly flexible, giving clients full control to start, stop, migrate, and restart computations in localized IoT devices as the mobile users move between different physical locations. As an example application of Aura, we have ported a lightweight version of MapReduce to run on IoT devices powered by Contiki OS. The prototype application was utilized to conduct various experimental measurements to evaluate different performance metrics of the proposed system. The paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of Aura with traditional clouds and applications running natively on mobile phones to assert the benefits and feasibility of the model."

Due to the characteristics of diversity and uncertainty in daily living applications, most existing complex activity recognition approaches have notable limitations. First, graphical model-based approaches still lack sufficient expressive power to model rich temporal relations among activities. Second, it would be rather difficult for graphical model-based approaches to build a unified model for achieving multiple types of tasks. Third, current semantic-based approaches often fail to capture uncertainties. Fourth, formulae in these semantic-based approaches are often manually encoded. Meanwhile, it is impractical to handcraft each formula accurately in daily living scenarios where temporal relations among activities are intricate. To address these issues, we present a probabilistic semantic-based framework that combines Markov logic network with 15 temporal and hierarchical relations to explicitly perform diverse inference tasks of daily living in a unified manner. Advanced pattern mining techniques are introduced to automatically learn the propositional logic rules of intricate relations as well as their weights. Experimental results show that by logical reasoning with the mined temporal dependencies under uncertainty, the proposed model leads to an improved performance, particularly when recognizing complex activities involving the incomplete or incorrect observations of atomic actions."

Context refers to the particular settings that give additional information on the reasons behind the set of data that is obtained and its value to the end user. Context is often derived through inferences and reasoning techniques, the aim being disambiguation, reducing doubts, and improve confidence levels. In essence, context is determined based on factors including time, location, frequency, participating persons and devices, etc. It is critical for data to be considered in its context, albeit the quality of context is equally important. How data is collected (processes), its usefulness (validity), its correctness (accuracy), and its up-to-dateness (latest facts) are just some key parameters considered in evaluating the quality of the data that is being processed. In recent years, there has been numerous attempts to deploy middeware agents such as brokers in a myriad of applications in domains such as retail, education, and healthcare. The context broker that is presented in this paper addresses some critical healthcare issues: availability, cost and quality. This broker is for general and specialised healthcare needs in specific medical fields, and it is especially useful in emergency situations. It showcases how a broker can be used to enhance the provision of cost-effective and quality medical services across the 34 main healthcare centres in the city of Pretoria. The context broker collects queries from users (patients or their dependents), and refers them to the best and most affordable hospitals on the basis of their geographical location, financial status, quality of care and the availability of the requested medical services at the time their request is made."

In this paper, we define a quality of private information (QoPI) model to represent various types and quality levels of users' private information required by mobile applications. Using the QoPI model, we can also represent contextual properties that might affect the selection of the types and quality of private information in dynamic mobile computing situations. Users' common privacy-control patterns can be characterized, represented, and managed by using this model, and we can assist users in achieving context-aware and personalized privacy control. We evaluate the effectiveness of using the QoPI model by analyzing the data that we collected from users while allowing them to consider practical mobile computing situations. The analysis results show that the users actively utilized the fine-grained (multi-level) privacy controls supported by using the QoPI model, and their privacy-control patterns could be effectively collected and predicted based on this model. The results also show that consideration of contextual properties is essential for improving the accuracy and time performance of predicting an appropriate QoPI level to be used when a user accesses a mobile application."

Gaze tracking has been used as an alternative to traditional pointing mechanisms during human computer interaction. Gaze direction provides also an implicit but imprecise hint about intention. This work uses gaze as a source of information about user׳s intention. We explore how to benefit from behind the scenes gaze tracking in a web browsing scenario by employing the user׳s PoR to prefetch URLs of potential future interest. Our working hypothesis is that before clicking on a URL of interest, the user would have previously fixated at the URL and/or the surrounding area. Hence, using gaze data to prefetch URLs can speed up web navigation and increase user comfort. The results of our experiments show that browsing the web using prefetching of web content based on gaze activity is in fact faster than traditional browsing. The caveat of our approach is that the network traffic volume increases as a result of the prefetching activity occurring in the browser׳s background. We have also carried out additional experiments to find out the optimal trade-off between speed gain and network traffic increase in a prefetching scenario. Leveraging upon the positive results of our experiments, we postulate the idea of an attentive computer system that monitors users gaze and takes preventive or assertive action in terms of what the user is likely to do next based on the direction of gaze. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the concept of prefetching content of potential future interest in advance using the information gathered by monitoring a user׳s gaze."

Also, the massive amount of data generated by sensors and smart objects led to a new kind of services known as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS). The quality of these services is highly dependent on the quality of sensed data (QoD), which is characterized by a number of quality attributes. DaaS provisioning is typically governed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between data consumers and DaaS providers. In this work, we propose a game-based approach for DaaS Provisioning, which relies on signaling based model for the negotiation of several QoD attributes between DaaS providers and data consumers. We consider that these entities are adaptive, rational, and able to negotiate the QoD offering even in the case of incomplete information about the other party. We use in the negotiation between the two parties a Q-learning algorithm for the signaling model and a Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) model to select the best signal. Moreover, we empirically validate the MADM model using Shannon’s entropy. The results obtained in the case of a multi-stages negotiation scenario show the convergence towards the pooling equilibrium."

The user’s position is the best available hint, but if we know what the user is looking at and what his or her gazing profile is, we can narrow down the possibly relevant objects of interest. With the advent of mobile and ubiquitous computing, it is time to explore the potential of mobile eye tracking technology for natural, intelligent interactions between users and their smart environment, not only for specific tasks, but also for the more ambitious goal of integrating eye tracking into the process of inferring mobile users’ interests, for the purpose of providing them with relevant services, a research area that has received little attention so far. In this work, we examine the potential of integrating a mobile eye tracker, as a natural interaction device, into an audio guide system for museum visitors. Using it as a pointing device enables the system to reason unobtrusively about the user’s focus of attention and to deliver relevant information about it as needed. To realize this goal, we integrated an image-matching based technique for indoor positioning and an eye-gaze detection technique to identify the user’s focus of attention into two different versions of a mobile audio guide: (1) a proactive version that delivers information automatically whenever user interest is detected, and (2) a reactive version that notifies the user about the availability of this information, thus giving the user more control over information delivery. Furthermore, we developed a conventional museum visitors’ mobile guide system using a smartphone and low-energy Bluetooth beacons for positioning; this guide was used as a reference system. The three museum visitors’ guides were evaluated in realistic settings at the Hecht1 1 http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/Default_eng.aspx.Museum, a small museum, located at the University of Haifa that has both archeological and art collections. The experimental evaluation compared the contribution of the three versions of the audio guide to the visit experience. The results showed that the mobile eye tracking technology, although unfamiliar, and perhaps even immature, was accepted by the participants. The mobile eye tracker audio guide was perceived as preferable to the conventional museum mobile guide, especially with regard to learning during the visit. Furthermore, with regard to proactivity in context-aware systems, the results showed that the participants like to be in control, and that most of them preferred the reactive version of the mobile eye tracker audio guide over the proactive one."

IoT devices provide services that are more significant about location and cost efficiency for both privacy and communication. In this paper, a location assisted delay-less service discovery (LDSD) for IoT users is introduced to minimize request–response delays. The proposed service discovery method searches cost effective resource for serving user requests with the knowledge of the resource location. With the knowledge of the location, LDSD classifies the resources based on service request delivery delay and availability for speedy resource mapping and service response. This resource discovery is also facilitated for replicated resource mapping considering service cost and request delivery delay ensuring minimum resource replication The performance of the proposed LDSD is verified through experiments and the benefit of the discovery method is assessed using the metrics: response time, failure rate, resource utilization, request delivery time, resource availability and service latency. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed LDSD by minimizing response time, failure rate, request delivery time and service latency and improving resource utilization and availability."

Lack of Situation Awareness (SA) when dealing with complex dynamic environments is recognized as one of the main causes of human errors, leading to serious and critical incidents. One of the main issues is the attentional tunneling manifested, for instance, by human operators (in Decision Support Systems) focusing their attention on a single goal and loosing the awareness of the global picture of the monitored environments. A further issue is represented by stimuli, coming from such environments, which may divert the attention of the operators from the most important aspects and cause erroneous decisions. Thus, the need to define systems helping human operators to improve SA with respect to the two aforementioned drawbacks emerges. These systems should help operators in focusing their attention on active goals and, when really needed, switching it on new goals, in a sort of continuous adaptation. In this work an adaptive goal selection approach exploiting both goal-driven and data-driven information processing is proposed. The approach has been defined and injected in an existing multi-agent framework for Situation Awareness and applied in a Fleet Management System. The approach has been evaluated by means of the SAGAT methodology."

We present the OpenThings platform as a basis to provide meaning via semantic technologies and demonstrate how it can be used to build environments that take into account a human-centered view of temporal and spatial context. We exemplify this by building a prototype for a system that supports proxemic interactions and time awareness."

We show that the RSSI threshold approach to detecting proximity is not feasible due to the optimal RSSI range being very small. Instead, we achieve an F-score of 82% with a simple method, k-nearest neighbor classification, using data from the whole population. This method does not need any historical data or training, calibration to an environment, nor find a specific RSSI threshold. Finally, we present result from a user study with a prototype meeting application that identifies meeting participants, and advice on consequences of the above result for UI design."

abstract = "Querying any point-of-interest (POI) in anywhere is a major part of location-based services (LBS) and has been applied to diverse wireless and/or mobile networks for realizing seamless services and mobile and ubiquitous computing. In particular, designing an efficient query processing scheme is admittedly challenging in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) because of the lack of centralized coordination, limited computing and communication capabilities, and time-varying network topologies. Unlike traditional stationary POIs, it also becomes challenging to consider mobile POIs that can invalidate prior query result. To address these challenges, we propose a set of query processing strategies based on a validity region to efficiently update the freshness of the queried POI and reduce the query traffic in MANETs. We first present and analyze time- and location-sensitive query types in the presence of static and mobile POIs and identify their corresponding query processing operations and implications. A time-sensitive query targets a POI containing a time-varying information while a location-sensitive query retrieves a location information. In this paper, we focus on location-sensitive query for both static and mobile POIs. Unlike a static POI, which is stationary and never changes its location, a mobile POI refers to a moving object and its location information is time varying. Then we propose basic rectangle and convex hull based validity regions and their corresponding query processing operations, and extend them by combining both techniques and considering an opportunistic overhearing. We also propose two more techniques in forming validity region for mobile POIs and their corresponding query processing operations to flexibly approximate the validity region. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and analysis, in which an infrastructure-based query processing approach is modified to work in MANETs for performance comparison. The simulation results indicate that the validity region based query processing strategies can reduce the number of queries and increase the time staying in the validity region."

This paper aims to contribute to this topic through a systematic and rigorous activity based on two main pillars of the empirical research in software engineering: i) a literature review addressing design and evaluation of tools for smart home control oriented to end users, and ii) an experimental study in which three tools, that emerged from the literature review as the most suitable and widespread, were compared in order to identify the interaction mechanisms that end users appreciate most. On the basis of the obtained results, a set of design implications that may drive the development of future tools for smart home control and management are presented."

This paper proposes an approach to synchronize the trajectory data of people by interpolation based on Catmull-Rom Spline. The optimal interpolating points are computed based on our proposed error function. Moreover, we propose an approach to assign the groups proper colors and then uses the hot map to show the dynamic changes of groups graphically. A real-life data set is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that 97.9% accuracy of group recognition can be achieved and the dynamic changes of groups is well shown."

This includes logistics in warehouses where validation of correct items per order can be enhanced with mobile devices. Since handling incorrect orders is a big part of the costs of warehouse maintenance, reducing errors like missed or wrong items should be avoided. Thus, early identification of picking procedures and items picked is beneficial for reducing these errors. By using data glasses and a smartwatch we aim to reduce these errors while also enabling the picker to work hands-free. In this paper, we present an analysis of feature sets for classification of grabbing actions in the order picking process. For this purpose, we created a dataset containing inertial data and egocentric video from four participants performing picking tasks, modeled closely to a real-world warehouse environment. We extract features from the time and frequency domain for inertial data and color and descriptor features from the image data to learn grabbing actions. By using three different supervised learning approaches on inertial and video data, we are able to recognize grabbing actions in a picking scenario. We show that the combination of both video and inertial sensors yields a F-measure of 85.3% for recognizing grabbing actions."

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications."

abstract = "Social media have emerged in the last decade as a viable and ubiquitous means of communication. The ease of user content generation within these platforms, e.g. check-in information, multimedia data, etc., along with the proliferation of Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled, always-connected capture devices lead to data streams of unprecedented amount and a radical change in information sharing. Social data streams raise a variety of practical challenges, including derivation of real-time meaningful insights from effectively gathered social information, as well as a paradigm shift for content distribution with the leverage of contextual data associated with user preferences, geographical characteristics and devices in general. In this article we present a comprehensive survey that outlines the state-of-the-art situation and organizes challenges concerning social media streams and the infrastructure of the data centres supporting the efficient access to data streams in terms of content distribution, data diffusion, data replication, energy efficiency and network infrastructure. We systematize the existing literature and proceed to identify and analyse the main research points and industrial efforts in the area as far as modelling, simulation and performance evaluation are concerned."

Smart healthcare wear system (SHWS) was designed with a sensor and transmission line based on electro-conductive filament yarn and electro-conductive fabric WD-270-NiCo. Without an arm band and wireless transmission sensor was selected as a portable and diminutive SHWS which was combined TENS. The results of effectiveness of cure performances were as follows: the mean of subject's blood pressure was significantly decreased to the lower values of after-wearing SHWS than before-wearing the SHWS with TENS in the systolic pressure (p-value; .0001***, p<.001), as t-test using statistical analysis method (SAS 9.1). The results of this study can offer to be applied to the effective treatment of another patient, and contribute to the further development of the wearable medical clothing profession by providing a stepping stone for high-tech smart medical clothing system with E-textiles."

This imposes restrictions on many aspects of the interaction. One key element in this is user authentication, because it assures the environment and related services of the legitimacy of user’s actions and empowers the user to carry out his tasks. We present five high-level categories of features of user authentication in the gadget-free world including security, privacy and usability aspects. These are adapted and extended from earlier research on web authentication methods. We survey existing authentication methods together with some emerging technologies and evaluate these according to the features in our categories. Our results show, that no single authentication method can realise all these requirements for authentication. In conclusion, we give future research directions and open problems that stem from our observations. Especially, finding combinations of authentication factors and methods that achieve all requirements is an interesting problem in the gadget-free scenario."

The problem is usually approached as a supervised classification task where a discriminative model is learned from known samples and a new query is assigned to a known activity label using learned model. The challenging issue here is how to feed this classifier with a fixed number of features where the real input is a raw signal of varying length. In this study, we consider three possible feature sets, namely time-domain, frequency domain and wavelet-domain statistics, and their combinations to represent motion signal obtained from accelerometer reads worn in chest through a mobile phone. In addition to a systematic comparison of these feature sets, we also provide a comprehensive evaluation of some preprocessing steps such as filtering and feature selection. The results determine that feeding a random forest classifier with an ensemble selection of most relevant time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from raw data can provide the highest accuracy in a real dataset."

Such McSoC devices allow superior performance gains while side-stepping the power and heat dissipation limitations of clock frequency scaling. The main advantage lies in the exploitation of parallelism, distributively and massively. Consequently, the on-chip communication fabric becomes the performance determinant. To bridge the widening gap between computation requirements and communication efficiency faced by gigascale McSoCs in the upcoming billion-transistor era, a new on-chip communication system, dubbed Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC), has been proposed by using the recently developed RF interconnect technology. With the high data-rate, low power and ultra-short range interconnection provided by UWB technology, the WiNoC design paradigm calls for effective solutions to overhaul the on-chip communication infrastructure of gigascale McSoCs. In this work, an irregular and reconfigurable WiNoC platform is proposed to tackle ever increasing complexity, density and heterogeneity challenges. A flexible RF infrastructure is established where RF nodes are properly distributed and IP cores are clustered. Consequently, a performance-cost effective topology is formed. A region-aided routing scheme is further deigned and implemented to realize loop-free, minimum path cost and high scalability for irregular WiNoC infrastructure. To implement the data transmission protocol, the RF microarchitecture of WiNoC is developed where the RF nodes are designed to fulfill the functions of distributed table routing, multi-channel arbitration, virtual output queuing, and distributed flow control. Our simulation studies based on synthetic traffics demonstrate the network efficiency and scalability of WiNoC."

Unfortunately, though many pathologies are widespread, there does not exist a unique standardized reference or Gold Standard according to which it is possible to evaluate the patients, mainly when the pathology is in the early stages or is not very noticeable, and the doctor is not sufficiently expert in the problem domain. In this work, we deal with this problem, by envisioning new healthcare services supporting a collaborative clinical analysis of symptoms collected from the patients and forwarded to a group of experts, which are geographically distributed. The experts return back their assessment and diagnosis and the system combines these by means of the Theory of the Evidence, in order to provide a single response. The above services can be easily implemented on top of state-of-the-art distributed computing facilities such as Grids or Clouds, providing a connected environment for medical data distributed over different sites and allowing medical experts to collaborate without being co-located, thereby providing transparent access to data and computing resources. Additionally, such services can provide feedbacks to each expert, in order to improve its own knowledge and experience in the case of divergence between the expert response and the global combined diagnosis in recognizing and classifying the received symptomatic indexes from the patient. We have considered the craniofacial pathologies in infant population as a practical example for better explaining the proposed solution."

Energy is often the most stringent constraint, necessitating techniques that facilitate operation in energy-saving modes. Broadcasting, typically over parallel channels, has proven to be an effective method for dissemination of public data to mobile devices. However, the employment of parallel channels introduces challenges associated with channel switching and conflicts due to concurrent accesses to multiple data items that ultimately increase energy consumption and response time. The detrimental effects on energy consumption and response time can be alleviated by scheduling the retrieval of data items in an order that reduces the number of passes over the air channels and channel switching between the parallel channels. In this paper, several scheduling algorithms are proposed and analyzed that achieve the aforementioned objectives. To further improve energy consumption and response time, the scope of our scheduling algorithms has been enhanced by replication of popular data items. The proposed scheduling algorithms, both with and without replication, have been simulated, and simulation results are presented and analyzed. These results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms, compared to some heuristic based methods, have greater impact in reducing energy consumption and response time. This reduction is shown to be more pronounced with replication of data items."

Crowd sourcing and sensing are relatively recent paradigms that, enabled by the pervasiveness of mobile devices, allow users to transparently contribute in complex problem solving. Their effectiveness depends on people voluntarism, and this could limit their adoption. Recent technologies for automating context-awareness could give a significant impulse to spread crowdsourcing paradigms. In this paper, we propose a distributed software system that exploits mobile devices to improve public transportation efficiency. It takes advantage of the large number of deployed personal mobile devices and uses them as both mule sensors, in cooperation with beacon technology for geofecing, and clients for getting information about bus positions and estimated arrival times. The paper discusses the prototype architecture, its basic application for getting dynamic bus information, and the long-term scope in supporting transportation companies and municipalities, reducing costs, improving bus lines, urban mobility and planning."

abstract = "Many of the existing management platforms such as pervasive computing systems implement policies that depend on dynamic operational environment changes. Existing formal approaches for automatically enforcing access control policies are primarily expressed in conventional logic programming, also known as monotonic logics, e.g., First Order Logic (FOL). The major issue with monotonic logics is that they are not devised to invalidate initial believes in the light of further observations. This limitation makes these traditional logical approaches less suitable for modeling and analyzing context-aware access control policies, where exceptional policies are introduced incrementally and adaptively during runtime. The inability to invalidate initial policies when an exception needs to be enforced might result in inconsistencies and violations that need to be resolved manually by human entities. To address the problems with conventional logical approaches and more importantly prevent such inconsistencies, this paper presents a non-monotonic logic-based reasoning scheme for modeling and analyzing adaptive access control policies. In the proposed formalism, unavailable context data and incomplete access control policies can be explicitly expressed. To do so, the paper distinguishes three kinds of policies: default, context-dependent and exception policies. The proposed formalism is based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), a non-monotonic logic programming language that allows elegant representation of unavailability of context data in adaptive systems. We devise non-monotonic policy inference rules such that, when exception policies are defined, they take precedence over default and context-dependent policies automatically. The results of two case studies are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed policy representation scheme compared to the Organizational-Based Access Control (OrBAC) model."

Therefore, the control of water resources to increase the allocation of retained water is very important. It has been observed in the last two decades, especially in the Indian sub-continent, the change of climate affects the agricultural crops production significantly. However, the prediction of good harvests before harvesting, enables the farmers as well as the government officials to take appropriate measures of marketing and storage of crops. Some strategies for predicting and modelling crop yields have been developed, although they do not take into account the characteristics of climate, and they are empirical in nature. In the proposed system, a Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been developed, allowing the allocation of water for farming under any conditions. The various parameters such as temperature, turbidity, pH., moisture have been collected by using Internet of Things (IoT) platform, equipped with related sensors and wireless communication systems. In this IoT platform the sensor data have been displayed in the cloud environment by using ThingSpeak.

The latter are on the rise since every new generation of smartphones is equipped with more resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, energy) to even allow resource-demanding services like speech- or face recognition to be executed locally on a device. But compared to their stationary counterparts, mobile devices remain comparatively limited in terms of resources. Because of this, current approaches aim at extending mobile device capabilities with computation and storage resources offered by cloud services or other nearby devices. This paradigm, known as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), is challenged by the dynamically changing context of mobile devices, which developers are required to take into account to decide, e.g., which application parts are when to offload. To rise to such and similar challenges we introduce the concept of Generic Context Adaptation (GCA), a data mining process that facilitates the adaptation of (mobile) applications to their current and future context. Moreover, we evaluate our approach with real usage data provided by the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) as well as with CloudAware, a context-adaptive mobile middleware for MCC that supports automated context-aware self-adaptation techniques."

abstract = "In this paper, we study the problem of activity recognition and abnormal behaviour detection for elderly people with dementia. Very few studies have attempted to address this problem presumably because of the lack of experimental data in the context of dementia care. In particular, the paper investigates three variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Vanilla RNNs (VRNN), Long Short Term RNNs (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit RNNs (GRU). Here activity recognition is considered as a sequence labelling problem, while abnormal behaviour is flagged based on the deviation from normal patterns. To provide an adequate discussion of the performance of RNNs in this context, we compare them against the state-of-art methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Na¨ıve Bayes (NB), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The results obtained indicate that RNNs are competitive with those state-of-art methods. Moreover, the paper presents a methodology for generating synthetic data reflecting on some behaviours of people with dementia given the difficulty of obtaining real-world data."

More devices can be added in a modular way to form a wireless body area network, and this can, in turn, be connected to a cloud infrastructure where data related to the navigational patterns of the user can be analyzed and help in making further predictions. Our system can also adapt to form part of an augmented environment where smart objects communicate and cooperate with each other to provide a more rich and complex navigation experience for the user. We show a series of experiments where various configurations of the system are tested with users who can not see and must navigate spaces previously unknown to them."

A hole is an area that has no active sensors, which makes a connection between one side of the network and the other side impossible. To avoid such holes, prior works detected them only when packets reached nodes near the hole, called dead-ends. In this case, the packets need to be rerouted, which results in additional communication cost. The ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is known to be suitable for dynamic environments, which makes it a good choice to deal with the hole problem. We study the capability of an ACO-based routing protocol, called the biologically inspired secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP), for resolving this issue. Because of its routing criteria, BIOSARP does not try to detect the holes after their appearance, but rather avoids them. Network simulator 2 (ns-2) is utilized to perform an analysis by adopting a flag-based feedback mechanism in BIOSARP and is further compared with on-demand routing with the void avoidance (ODVA) protocol in terms of the delivery ratio and energy consumption. Findings clearly demonstrate that BIOSARP can efficiently maintain the network prior to any possible hole problems, by switching data forwarding to the most optimal neighboring node. Thus, it can self-adapt to faults appearing in PWSN and efficiently maintains the network communication."

In this approach, the components are described and virtualized in a module communicating through two dedicated events, they are registered in a Resources Manager to facilitate the fine management of concurrent multimodal interactions, and the system supports an interoperable discovery, registration and filtering of the features provided by heterogeneous and dynamic components in the web of things.

In MEC, many small cell base stations (sBSs) are deployed to establish a mobile edge network (MEN). These sBSs can be usually accessed directly by mobile users. The computational tasks are first offloaded from mobile users to the MEN and then executed in one or several specific sBSs in the MEN. While the offloading decision has been well studied, the task execution delay on the MEN side is overlooked. This paper aims at reducing the task execution delay by task scheduling in MENs. Specifically, we jointly consider the task properties, the user mobility and network constraints. The problem is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem and a lightweight heuristic solution is proposed for fast scheduling. We conduct simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed work. The results show that our work is able to significantly reduce the task execution delay in MENs and thus reduces the end-to-end delay for MEC tasks."

The proposed features for a social workflow service could help individuals to accomplish their private goals. The presented idea is contrasted with established research areas and applications to show the degree of novelty of this work. It is shown how novel ideas for knowledge management, facilitated by a process-oriented case-based reasoning approach, support private individuals and how they can obtain an appropriate social workflow through sharing and reuse of respective experience.

While successful for low-level activities (e.g. walking or standing), high-level activities (e.g. watching movies or attending lectures) are difficult to distinguish from motion data alone. Furthermore, instrumentation of complex body sensor network at population scale is impractical. In this work, we take an alternative approach of leveraging rich, dynamic, and crowd-generated self-report data from social media platforms as the basis for in-situ activity recognition. By treating the user as the “sensor”, we make use of implicit signals emitted from natural use of mobile smartphones, in the form of textual content, semantic location, and time. Tackling both the task of recognizing a main activity (multi-class classification) and recognizing all applicable activity categories (multi-label tagging) from one instance, we are able to obtain mean accuracies of more than 75%. We conduct a thorough analysis and interpret of our model to illustrate a promising first step towards comprehensive, high-level activity recognition using instrumentation-free, crowdsourced, social media data."

IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison to its merits over the others."

However, effective use of robotic agents typically requires the user to issue control commands in the form of speech, gesture, or text. Thus, for unskilled or impaired users, the need for a paradigm of intuitive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is prevalent. It can be inferred that the most productive interactions are those in which the assistive agent is able to ascertain the intention of the user. Also, to perform a task, the agent must know the user's area of attention in three-dimensional space. Eye gaze tracking can be used as a method to determine a specific Volume of Interest (VOI). However, gaze tracking has heretofore been under-utilized as a means of interaction and control in 3D space. This research aims to determine a practical volume of interest in which an individual's eyes are focused by combining past methods in order to achieve greater effectiveness. The proposed method makes use of eye vergence as a useful depth discriminant to generate a tool for improved robot path planning. This research investigates the accuracy of the Vector Intersection (VI) model when applied to a usably large workspace volume. A neural network is also used in tandem with the VI model to create a combined model. The output of the combined model is a VOI that can be used as an aid in a number of applications including robot path planning, entertainment, ubiquitous computing, and others."

Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL."

abstract = "The objective of Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous computing. As a result many computing enabled, connected devices are deployed in various environments, where these devices keep generating unbounded event streams related to the deployed environment. The common paradigm is to process these event streams at the cloud using the available Distributed Stream Processing (DSP) frameworks. However, with the emergence of Edge Computing, another convenient computing paradigm has been presented for executing such applications. Edge computing introduces the concept of using the underutilised potential of a large number of computing enabled connected devices such as IoT, located outside the cloud. In order to develop optimal strategies to utilise this vast number of potential resources, a realistic test bed is required. However, due to the overwhelming scale and heterogeneity of the edge computing device deployments, the amount of effort and investment required to set up such an environment is high. Therefore, a realistic simulation environment that can accurately predict the behaviour and performance of a large-scale, real deployment is extremely valuable. While the state-of-the-art simulation tools consider different aspects of executing applications on edge or cloud computing environments, we found that no simulator considers all the key characteristics to perform a realistic simulation of the execution of DSP applications on edge and cloud computing environments. To the best of our knowledge, the publicly available simulators lack being verified against real world experimental measurements, i.e. for calibration and to obtain accurate estimates of e.g. latency and power consumption. In this paper, we present our ECSNeT++ simulation toolkit which has been verified using real world experimental measurements for executing DSP applications on edge and cloud computing environments. ECSNeT++ models deployment and processing of DSP applications on edge-cloud environments and is built on top of OMNeT++/INET. By using multiple configurations of two real DSP applications, we show that ECSNeT++ is able to model a real deployment, with proper calibration. We believe that with the public availability of ECSNeT++ as an open source framework, and the verified accuracy of our results, ECSNeT++ can be used effectively for predicting the behaviour and performance of DSP applications running on large scale, heterogeneous edge and cloud computing device deployments."

In spite of the extensive literature on FDSs, an open issue is the definition of a common framework that allows a methodical and agreed evaluation of fall detection policies. In this regard, a key aspect is the lack of a public repository of movement datasets that can be employed by the researchers as a common reference to compare and assess their proposals. This work describes UMAFall, a new dataset of movement traces acquired through the systematic emulation of a set of predefined ADLs (Activities of Daily Life) and falls. In opposition to other existing databases for FDSs, which only include the signals captured by one or two sensing points, the testbed deployed for the generation of UMAFall dataset incorporated five wearable sensing points, which were located on five different points of the body of the participants that developed the movements. As a consequence, the obtained data offer an interesting tool to investigate the importance of the sensor placement for the effectiveness of the detection decision in FDSs."

abstract = "Building managers need effective tools to improve occupants’ experiences considering constraints of energy efficiency. Current building management systems are limited to coordinating device services in simple and prefixed situations. Think of an office with lights offering services, such as turn on a light, which are invoked by the system to automatically control the lights. In spite of the evident potential for energy saving, the office occupants often end up in the dark, they have too much light when working with computers, or unnecessary lights are turned on. The office is thus not aware of the occupants’ presence nor anticipates their activities. Our proposal is to coordinate services while anticipating occupant activities with sufficient accuracy. Finding and composing services that will support occupant activities is however a complex problem. The high number of services, the continuous transformation of buildings, and the various building standards imply a search through a vast number of possible contextual situations every time occupants perform activities. Our solution to this building coordination problem is based on Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning in combination with activity recognition. While HTN planning provides powerful means for composing services automatically, activity recognition is needed to identify occupant activities as soon as they occur. The output of this combination is a sequence of services that needs to be executed under the uncertainty of building environments. Our solution supports continuous context changes and service failures by using an advanced orchestration strategy. We design, implement and deploy a system in two cases, namely offices and a restaurant, in our own office building at the University of Groningen. We show energy savings in the order of 80% when compared to manual control in both cases, and 60% when compared to using only movement sensors. Moreover, we show that one can save a figure of €600 annually for the electricity costs of the restaurant. We use a survey to evaluate the experience of restaurant occupants. The majority of them are satisfied with the solution and find it useful. Finally, the technical evaluation provides insights into the efficiency of our system."

The product development process benefits greatly from the knowledge of the incidence and the relevance of applications performed by a user. Using the collected sensor data remains a challenge due to the noise caused by the consumer grade sensors and the complexity of the applications. In this study, the use of machine learning on time series to identify which predefined applications a user performed with a power tool, using an angle grinder and a cordless screwdriver as example, is explored. An acceleration sensor, a rotation rate sensor, a geomagnetic sensor and a current sensor were used for data acquisition. We tested two sampling rates and two approaches of feature extraction: An effectively off-the-shelf method of feature extraction and an expert-tuned extraction of the features. The study shows that both methods achieve very good results within existing data sets (>95% accuracy). When applied to new experiments, overfitting occurs due to the complexity of the application and the noise of the consumer-grade sensors. Thus, this study shows first promising results and further potentials for the future application of machine learning for the recognition of applications in products such as handheld power tools."

An ambient intelligence system uses information of devices to represent the context of the home and its residents. Based on a context database, this system infer the daily life activities of the resident. Hence, abnormal behavior or chronic disease can be detected by the system. Due to the complexity of these systems, a large variety of anomalies may occur and disrupt the functioning of critical and essential applications. To detect anomalies and take appropriate measures, an anomaly management system has to be integrated in the overall architecture. In this paper, we propose an anomaly management framework for smart homes. This framework eases the work of designers in the conception of anomaly detection modules and processes to respond to an anomaly appropriately. Our framework can be used in all heterogeneous environments such as smart home because it uses Semantic Web ontologies to represent anomaly information. Our framework can be useful to detect hardware, software, network, operator and context faults. To test the efficiency of our anomaly management framework, we integrate it in the universAAL middleware. Based on a reasoner, our framework can easily infer some context anomalies and take appropriate measures to restore the system in a full functioning state."

To achieve efficient authorized communication, multi-server based authentication protocols have been designed. The key feature of multi-server based protocols is one time registration. We study the existing multi-server based authentication protocols, and identify that many of the multi-server based authentication protocols involve control server in mutual authentication or trusted server environment is required. The involvement of central authority in mutual authentication may be a bottleneck for large network, and the servers may be semi-trusted. To erase these drawbacks, Wei et al. recently proposed a multi-server based authentication protocol. Their protocol does not require all servers to be trusted and involvement of control server in mutual authentication. Unfortunately, we identify the security vulnerability of Wei et al.'s scheme to insider attack and password guessing attack. Additionally, lack of pre-smart card authentication leads to denial of service attack. To enhance the security of Wei et al.'s protocol, we propose a secure biometric-based authentication scheme for multi-server environment using smart card. We simulate the proposed protocol for the formal security verification using the widely accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our scheme is secure against active and passive attacks. In addition, we prove that our proposed scheme provides mutual authentication using the widely-accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and is also secured against various well known attacks. In addition, our scheme is efficient in terms of computational and communication overheads as compared to Wei et al.'s scheme and other existing related schemes."

This paper argues, based on a bibliometric study of the representation of a mobile ICT discourse within the AIS Senior Scholars’ ‘basket’ of eight IS journals over the past 15years, that the field needs to become much more academically agile. The study showed that a mere 3.2% of all papers published during this period had any relationship to one of the key technological phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between European- and US-based journals within the ‘basket of 8’ could have been influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the IS field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the IS field may still be stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully engage with the world we live in."

It can be defined as the union and cooperation of paradigms such as Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS) and Internet of Content (IoC). In these paradigms, the role of Service oriented Computing (SoC) deserves special attention. FI can be defined as an association of web services encompassing innovative services such as converged services, intelligent services and related smart services for overcoming the structural limitations of the current internet. Among many key concerns in the services environment, service discovery and optimal service selection are considered to be vital. Service discovery enables the client to get access to the right service at the right time to complete the requested tasks while service selection determines the feasible service composition that fulfils a set of conditions while maintaining a rich Quality of User Experience (QoUE) and good Quality of Service (QoS). This paper proposes the FI middleware named MIFIM (MIddleware for Future Internet Models) incorporated with Aspect Oriented Module (AOM) for addressing the challenges in particular related to the unknown topology and missing data estimation present in IoT service discovery and optimal service selection routine named Composite Service Selection Module (CSSM) for deriving the best service composition in IoS paradigm. The AOM is evaluated in accordance with MUSIC pervasive computing middleware while CSSM is compared with the other optimality approaches. Experimental results were found encouraging and the proposed components were performing reasonably well when compared to the similar solutions."

In this study, we investigated the correlation between the two psychological responses and EOG parameters. We could confirm the qualitative correlation between the EOG parameter corresponding to concentration power and the psychological response. At this point, we presume that it could be applied to e-learning in virtual classrooms soon.

The IoT (Internet of Things) concept is being widely discussed as the major approach towards the next industry revolution - Industry 4.0.

This paper discusses the feasibility of improving system-level performance in industrial production plants by integrating social network into the IoT concept. We proposed the concept of SIoIT (Social Internet of Industrial Things) which enables the cooperation between assets by sharing status data and optimal operation and maintenance decision-making via analysis of these data. We also identified the building blocks of SIoIT and characteristics of one of its important components - Social Assets.

Current projects on health games, however, face a serious challenge: evaluation methods used to assess and formatively evaluate such games do not adequately gauge acceptability and integration of the game into participants’ lives. These are crucial elements to enable adherence of the participants to the game to induce behavior change. In this paper we present a formative evaluation methodology we developed, called Data-Driven Retrospective Interviewing (DDRI). Used within naturalistic settings, DDRI investigates how participants accept and integrate a game into their lives. The method is comprised of several steps. A game is first instrumented to collect behavioral data, which is then analyzed to inform the construction of interview questions used to retrospectively contextualize and reflect on participants’ behaviors. The contribution of this paper is: the methodology and its application to evaluate a pervasive health game called SpaPlay (Seif El-Nasr et al., 2011). Findings of this investigation helped designers re-think and augment their design as they uncovered how users used their game, which, in some cases, was different from how they initially intended. Such findings would have not been possible using conventional evaluation methods."

Providing such formal context representation allows us to make context information an integrated and reusable part of the software engineering domain.

However, one important limitations of mobile devices is energy efficiency. This work has proposed an energy efficient fog-based face recognition using mobile platform. The architecture in proposed system initially performs the facial part detection on mobile device and uploads the selected part by discarding the rest. This reduces the network traffic and attempts to reduce energy consumption. Preliminary results have indicated a saving of approximately 93% of energy in mobile devices."

To cope with this, in this paper, we suggested discovery protocols in two different circumstances.

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development."

We propose a simple strategy to encode paths and define path operations, such as addition and scalar multiplication, so that the discrete paths can fit into the DE framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three applications: (1) computing discrete geodesic paths on surfaces with non-uniform density function; (2) finding a smooth path that follows a given vector field as much as possible; and (3) finding a curve on a terrain with (near-) constant slope."

Since the patient-related data in the form of text, image, voice, etc. is significant in the process of healthcare services, efficiently managing these media data from various WBAN is vital for various applications. Recently, Cloud-assisted WBAN has become popular that can supply massive computing, flexible storage and various software services to WBAN. Still, there are some challenging issues exist in this platform to deliver and share the huge media healthcare data to remote terminals timely with guaranteed QoS support. In the paper, we propose an efficient network model that combines WBAN and Cloud for valid data sharing. The proposed network architecture is designed as four layers: perception layer, network layer, cloud computing layer, and application layer. In the network, the integration of TCP/IP and Zigbee in the coordinator devices is utilized. Consequently, WBAN coordinators can compatibility inter-operate with various local networks such as WiFi and LTE network to support high mobility of users. Besides, we integrate Content Centric Networking (CCN) with our proposed architecture to improve the ability of the WBAN coordinator. Thus, it can support uninterrupted media healthcare content delivery. In addition, adaptive streaming technique was also utilized to reduce packet loss. Various simulations were conducted using OPNET simulator to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture in terms of transmitting a huge amount of media healthcare data in real-time under traditional IP-based network."

Nonetheless, it seems that context-aware applications are still struggling to provide the user with a real situation understanding. They only consider non-evolving limited scenarios and react to them using only generic services. To address these concerns, we have developed the Long Life Application, a dynamic context-aware situation-based distributed mobile application dedicated to assist end-users in their everyday needs. This application considers the requirements of the users and provides them with the appropriate services according to their current context. In this paper we focus in the way that the user’s context is considered by the application. We propose a hybrid approach that combines both high-level context (top-down approach), by injecting user-related context, and a low-level context (bottom-up approach), by inferring it from sensor data."

For such systems, new communication technologies are constructed to cope with the increasing functional and temporal demans. Because of the ubiquitousness of mobile devices nowadays, for example, traditional publish/subscribe is no longer an adequate model for data dissemination in mobile networks. Since any node can publish content at any time, the network can get congested easily, so a dissemination paradigm where mobile nodes contribute with a fraction of their resources is needed, through the use of opportunistic networks. Furthermore, a suitable organization for data dissemination in mobile networks should be centered around interests. Thus, we propose a unified interest-based dissemination framework for opportunistic networks entitled Interest Spaces, which simplifies dissemination by just allowing applications to mark data items with certain tags, letting the framework handle the caching, routing, forwarding, and disseminating. Similarly, applications that need to subscribe to channels simply have to specify the tags they are interested in, and the framework does the rest. However, the Interest Spaces framework also allows applications to have more control over the dissemination process if they wish, by specifying various criteria and dissemination rules. In this article, we present the architecture and components of Interest Spaces. We focus on data aggregation at the context layer, showing through simulations the benefits it brings in opportunistic dissemination. We also present a real-life use case for Interest Spaces through Chatty, an opportunistic chat application."

Recently, a lot of studies have been focused on the use of smartphones for automatic detection of transportation mode. This task is made easy by the availability of sensors like accelerometer and GPS in modern smartphones. The advantages include the increased accuracy which was partially lost due to underreporting in case of conventional travel surveys. In this paper Probe Person data collected by 46 participants in three different cities of Japan, namely Niigata, Gifu and Matsuyama, was used. Although the data, comprising of acceleration and GPS information, was collected by a wearable device but the same can be achieved very easily with the help of smartphones. In order to address the most important problem of continuously changing position of smartphone during the trip, only resultant acceleration was taken. In addition, personal characteristics like age and gender were also included. Regarding GIS information, distance and time calculated by Google Maps for both driving and walking was introduced to increase the prediction accuracy. Random Forest was applied for the purpose of prediction. 70% of the data was randomly selected to train the algorithm and rest 30% was used to test it. Prediction was done among four different modes; walk, bicycle, car and train. The results are quite promising with an overall prediction accuracy of more than 99.6% for all three cities. A slight improvement in the prediction accuracy is achieved by selecting the best features for the classification purpose."

We use a dataset of 4332 protein-structures to generate uPhi and uPsi based score libraries to be used within the core 3DIGARS method.

India ranks second in Asia for its overall oil reserve but to meet the rising demands of oil, India is the fifth largest importer of crude oil in the world. Cross country pipelines are a safest, economical and most eco-friendly method of transportation of crude oil imported to India, flowing from offshore to a petrochemical plant. These pipelines are the arteries and veins of the fuel industry, similar to natural one in these artificial arteries the crude oil is continuously flowing in deeply buried cross-country pipelines containing slug and wax which get deposited within the pipeline creating a blockage and the situation gets even worse due to the presence of corrosion & erosion because of their.

We aim in this paper to design a framework that promotes the ability to specify and verify context-aware systems to assist and facilitate designer’s task. The objective is gained here by combining two complementary modeling techniques: Model-driven Engineering (MDE) and Formal Methods. Model-driven technique is adopted to design a modeling framework for context-aware systems. Nevertheless, this technique generally lacks formal semantics and it is unfit for model analysis. Therefore, we define a formal semantics to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, we show how context-aware system’s adaptive behavior can be verified according to their invariants by applying model-checking techniques."

abstract = "Providing accurate information about human activity is an important task in a smart city environment. Human activity is complex, and it is important to use the best technology and benefit from the machine learning to learn about human activity. Although people have been interested in the past decade in recording human activities, there are still major aspects to be addressed to take advantage of technology in the knowledge of human activity. In this paper, Adaboost ensemble classifier is used to recognize human activity data taken from body sensors. Ensemble classifiers achieve better performance by using a weighted combination of several classifier models. Many researchers have shown the efficiencies of ensemble classifiers in different real-world problems. Experimental results have shown the feasibility of Adaboost ensemble classifiers by achieving the better performance for automated human activity recognition by using human body sensors. Results have shown that ensemble classifiers based on Adaboost algorithm significantly improve the performance of automated human activity recognition (HAR)."

Particularly, in this study, urban vehicle trajectory prediction is studied using trajectory data of vehicles in urban traffic network. In the previous work, Recurrent Neural Network model for urban vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed. For the further improvement of the model, in this study, we propose Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network model for urban vehicle trajectory prediction. In this proposed model, we use attention mechanism to incorporate network traffic state data into urban vehicle trajectory prediction. The model is evaluated by using the Bluetooth data collected in Brisbane, Australia, which contains the movement information of private vehicles. The performance of the model is evaluated with 5 metrics, which are BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, and METEOR. The result shows that ARNN model have better performance compared to RNN model."

To address the issues of traditional security techniques, this paper proposes, Location Information Verification cum Security (LIVES) based on Transferable Belief Model (TBM). In LIVES, two level location information verification is carried out. In level-1 tiles based verification technique is used to verify the correctness of location information. In level-2, collective belief about the announced position information of each vehicle is calculated using TBM with the help of neighbor list information from all neighboring vehicles. A secured geocast routing (SGR) protocol is developed using the two level location verification technique. Simulations are carried out using ns-2 and results have been analyzed in terms of location error probability. The comparative analysis of simulation results confirm the better suitability of LIVES ascompared to the state-of-the-art technique: A-VIP in high dynamic vehicular adhoc network environment."

A carefully designed mobile application that offers various services facilitating user participation in outdoor events and enhancing personal experience could make an event stand out from the rough competition and attract more spectators. In this work we propose a prototype system that tries to implement dissemination and exploitation activities for carnival events in a trustworthy and efficient way. The system offers carnival event organizers and local businesses the opportunity to increase sources of revenue by implementing various exploitation services. Moreover, the system attempts to create a vivid online community of individuals that communicate, exchange opinions and create personal experiences that share with the rest of the community, enriching carnival-related system content. An authorization mechanism is applied to all user content requests to prevent content misuse. The proposed system is compared to other applications concerning spectators of outdoor events based on offered services. Evaluation results suggest that the presented system is a first attempt towards a mobile system that supports carnival organizers to accomplish efficient event management, monitoring and administration, spectators to live an enhanced event experience and local markets to gain additional revenue."

The factors are explored as human values and the methodology how designers should take these values into account is examined. The results show that user intentions and behaviors are largely influenced by the perceived values of cloud services, which include availability, access, security and reliability. These values were found to be the significant antecedents of usefulness and ease of use in cloud computing. Theoretically, the model proposed in this paper advances the existing technology acceptance models and can be used to predict the acceptance and diffusion of cloud computing. Practically, the findings should guide the government and industry promoting cloud services to increase user acceptance by enhancing user experience and ensuring security."

Beacon positioning determination using current approaches is supported by pre-calculated formulas, for generic beacons, whereas the position can be accurately estimated with a low error up to a small distance; or based on fingerprinting the signal for the given space. In both cases, the accuracy variate depending on hardware specifications and other conditions such as beacon brand, wrap material, temperature, wind, location, surrounding interference, battery strength, among others. This paper introduces a method for beacon-based positioning, based on signal strength measurements at key distances for each beacon. This method allows for different beacon types, brands, and conditions. Depending on each situation (i.e., hardware and location) it is possible to adapt the distance measuring curve to minimize errors and support higher distances, while at the same time keeping good precision. Moreover, this paper also presents a comparison with traditional positioning method, using formulas for distance estimation, and then position triangulation. Performed tests took place at the library of the campus of the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu. Experimental results show that the proposed position technique has 13.2% better precision than triangulation, for distances up to 10 meters."

Targeted drug delivery has more powerful impact as compared to metallic stents with thin coating of drug. Numerous research groups have investigated biodegradable materials like corrosive metals, polycarbonates, polyesters & bacterial-derived polymers for developing stents. A biodegradable stent is assumed to be ideal if it can be accurately installed under the fluoroscopic regulation and detect the target lesion with a trivial endovascular torment. Likewise, the advantages of bio-absorbable polymeric stents are not correlated with late stent thrombosis and leave no stent behind, they are completely suitable for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Multi-Slice Computer Tomography (MSCT) imaging.

The filter was checked on MATLAB environment and found to suppress high density salt and pepper noise. For better speed & power constraints the algorithm was implemented on VIRTEX FPGA using VHDL as part of system on chip implementation. The Proposed VLSI architecture uses one hot encoding for Finite state machine implementation of the filter. The architecture has 5 different modules and each computes the desired values using Finite state machine. There are three main computations implemented in this filter as separate module titled asymmetrical trimmed median, Midpoint, Mean of 4 Neighbors and local mean. The FSM uses one hot encoding Technique for lower power consumption. The architecture was targeted on FPGA device XCV1000-4bq560 using VHDL.

Ideally, this interaction is based on a reliable connection between the communicating devices, which is often not the case. Since most use cases do not adequately address this issue, service quality is often compromised. Aimed to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach to forecast the connectivity and bandwidth of mobile devices by applying machine learning to the context data recorded by the various sensors of the mobile device. This concept, designed as a microservice, has been implemented in the mobile middleware CloudAware, a system software infrastructure for mobile cloud computing that integrates easily with mobile operating systems, such as Android. We evaluate our approach with real sensor data and show how to enable mobile devices in the IoT to make assumptions about their future connectivity, allowing for intelligent and distributed decision making on the mobile edge of the network."

The paper proposes a regression approach to solving the task of missed data recovery. The authors have developed a composition of the method of the missing data recovery for IoT systems based on the use of the Ito decomposition and the AdaBoost algorithm. We transform each data vectors by using Ito decomposition, and searching the coefficients of this decomposition scheme using AdaBoost algorithm. Increasing the dimensionality of the input space due to the use of the second-degree Ito decomposition scheme, as well as its high approximation properties, allowed to increase the accuracy of filling the missed values by the AdaBoost regressor at more than 6% (MAPE). It has been established that the developed method provides the highest accuracy of filling missed data based on all other indicators (MAE, RMSE, SMAPE) among the considered regression methods."

Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to fulfill a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals’ meeting."

This paper examines consumer behavior responses while using a mobile instant messaging (MIM) channel adopted by a Chinese pure-play retailer. MIM is text-based, mobile computer-mediated communication technology accomplishing real-time interaction with other users. WeChat, a full service MIM application, contains functional and social features including SMS, LBS, voice message, video calls and "Moments" sharing, which is its social propagating feature. There is a paucity of literature on the role of MIM in building relationships and the relevance of emotion and WOM for consumers engaging in MIM interactions. The model was derived from prior research on Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) that depicts the effects of environmental/informational stimuli on consumers' responses. Research objectives included investigating the prediction that environmental stimuli comprising socialness perception, media richness, and involvement induce a positive emotional state, which results in positive WOM. The study employed a quantitative approach. The sample comprised young Chinese WeChat users (n = 486). SEM was used to analyse the data. Prior research has indicated that building relationships with consumers is more difficult when the relationships are consumer-computer as compared to consumer-person. The findings of this study suggest that such a negative effect can be alleviated by the use of MIM. This study is original in integrating socialness perception, media richness and WOM into the SOR framework. The implications for practitioners are discussed, including retailers' need to be aware of the extent to which consumers are willing to engage with MIM applications."

In WSN, optimization and load balancing of network resources are critical concern to provide the intelligence for long duration. Since clustering the sensor nodes can significantly enhance overall system scalability and energy efficiency this paper presents a distributed cluster head scheduling (DCHS) algorithm to achieve the network longevity in WSN. The major novelty of this work is that the network is divided into primary and secondary tiers based on received signal strength indication of sensor nodes from the base station. The proposed DCHS supports for two tier WSN architecture and gives suggestion to elect the cluster head nodes and gateway nodes for both primary and secondary tiers. The DCHS mechanism satisfies an ideal distribution of the cluster head among the sensor nodes and avoids frequent selection of cluster head, based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and residual energy level of the sensor nodes. Since the RSSI is the key parameter for this paper, the practical experiment was conducted to measure RSSI value by using MSP430F149 processor and CC2500 transceiver. The measured RSSI values were given input to the event based simulator to test the DCHS mechanism. The real time experimental study validated the proposed scheme for various scenarios."

In this paper, we present a qualitative evaluation of IPv6 for the industrial internet of things. We have conducted expert interviews with five industrial IPv6 users. Our key results indicate that the major problems are threefold: First, tool support and existing libraries are incomplete or immature. Second, users still often have to manually configure the IP communication. Third, there are complicated one-fits-all protocols prevalent. We derive recommendations for further developments to advance and ease the use of IPv6 for smart manufacturing systems."

A major challenge being faced by CNN architectures today is their need for a large amount of memory and processing power to deliver their exceptional performance. This hampers their deployment on less powerful devices like smart-phones whose ubiquity is unmatched. This paper critically analyzes a CNN based network architecture wherein convolutions are approximated by XNOR operations and bit-counts which are primarily binary operations hence making the network much faster and more memory efficient than standard CNN architectures. The aim of this paper is to assess the performance of the aforementioned architecture for the task of facial recognition with Minimum Barrier Salient Object Detection (MBD) as a preprocessing step and to examine the affect self-normalizing properties induced by the Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation function on the convergence of the network and benchmark it against the convergence performance of the same network incorporating the widely used Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) as its activation function. Two widely known datasets, Faces95 and Faces96, pre-processed using Minimum Barrier Detection (MBD) for saliency detection were used benchmarking the performance of the proposed networks. It was observed that the network using SELU converged faster than RELU for the Faces95 dataset and both converged at similar rates for Faces96 dataset. The network with SELU gave better accuracy than RELU for both the datasets."

abstract = "Relational databases hold a leading position in database industry and are better know as workhorses of database industry. They are one of most popular and commonly used medium for recording, manipulating and retrieving data. They find its application in varied and protean requirements including data mining, business intelligence and analytical querying. However, new requirements from database developers started coming up with the arrival of web 3.0 and data explosion with big data and social networks. These requirements focused more on relationships in data, thus making graph-structured data important. Graph database provide flexible structure to address graph data. However, there are various domains that give rise to graph+relational queries, which leads to the development of hybrid database. Hybrid model design is integration of two popular database models in single framework in order to abolish the drawbacks of the each system. This paper briefs about the previous researches done in the development of hybrid database model and attempts to propose a hybrid system."

Timely loss-of-contact detection between devices in pervasive systems using mobile networks is an important aspect for both functionality and user experience. Traditional schemes where time-to-live is defined by the service provider are not adequate in mobile networks where communication failures are frequent. On the other hand, schemes using keep-alive messaging tend to increase the communication overhead, in particular if the time to detect a loss of contact needs to be short. We introduce a strategy where the time between keep-alive messages is adjusted dynamically according to the need in a particular application. Our solution was evaluated with usage data from a professional application built on the PalCom framework. The measurements show a 96 % decrease of the communication overhead while still maintaining the same system responsiveness."

Except system credibility, the PSD elements have different impact on customer acceptance depending on country. The study findings suggest that app designers benefit by employing PSD to target global users with minimal localization implementation.

Smart sensing technologies play a key role in the core of smart systems, which form the rapidly evolving internet of things. In this context, buildings’ occupancy information is an important input that allows smart systems to be seamlessly aware of and responsive to the inhabitants, thus ensuring their comfort. In this paper we present UltraSense, an ultrasound-based room occupancy sensing system that relies on unsupervised learning, to automatically calibrate its parameters according to the room's environment. This ability avoids the need for manual calibration of the sensing system for each new environment. While commonly available occupancy detection technologies are limited to line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, UltraSense also operates in non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The proposed system was implemented and tested in order to characterize its performance. UltraSense was developed for the European research project SmartHeat in the frame of ambient assisted living."

A new multi-objective clustering algorithm ‘MOEHA’ is proposed based on recently reported Elephant Herding Algorithm (EHA). The MOEHA performance on clustering is demonstrated on three synthetic and six real world datasets. Comparative results demonstrated superior performance over benchmark algorithms NSGA-II and MOPSO. Five case studies on the classification of human physical actions demonstrated better results over the comparative algorithms."

Further more, morphological determination is then made at different time on fixed, killed and stained sample. Several advanced sperm selection methods were currently used prior to ART, these are inadequate and fail to ensure spermatozoa with optimum quality. To assist in these microscopic measurements, several manufactures have developed and introduced into the market Computer Aided Sperm Analysis (CASA). These CASA machines can improve the accuracy of the microscopic measures, although major problem with them are: difficulty in tracking sperm trajectories, separate software is required to analyze sperm morphology and in addition high purchase costs, CASA machines are rarely used in routine laboratories. Clinician or researcher believe that the motile sperms are morphologically normal, whereas in reality this is not always the case. In this paper we have developed image analysis system using open source software IMAGEJ, which perform the test simultaneously to extract the sperm cells from the input video and perform the motility analysis with morphology on each sperm. Motility with morphology analysis using one-test procedure helps embryologist to improve fertility rate in assisted reproductive techniques."

However, they are not restricted to standard BPMN elements and they generate IoT device specific low-level code.

In many cases, elements impacting decisions are not totally mastered by the decision support system since the activity of the user is highly influenced by the dynamic change of the production system. Thus, in order to set the appropriate context elements surrounding different working situations of factory actors, this paper proposes a context model aiming to represents user's activity and the circumstances under the decisionmaking process. The literature of related works highlighted the advantages of context-awareness in supporting the dynamic adaptation of information according to user's context. The proposed model in this paper takes advantage from the context notion and the fundaments of the activity theory proposed in cognitive science. The intended model is used in an intelligent assistant system dedicated to assist factory workers in the manufacturing process. The main purpose of the context model is to help the assistant system in handling the process of knowledge adaptation and therefore, avoiding the problems of overload and misinterpretation of the information."

The requirement for scalability, due to the possibly huge amount of involved sensors and devices, and the heterogeneous scenarios that might occur, impose resorting to sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques. In particular, multi-level simulation is regarded as a main framework that allows simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping high levels of detail, when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized countrysides. Moreover, the performance evaluation confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments."

These findings along with previous research suggest that in order to fully realize the potential benefits of the digital age in regards to patient health, positive patient-provider discussions regarding information found online, efforts to improve general health literacy and improvements in the quality and accuracy of the information found are key.

In Conventional PID Controller there is a difficulty to control the value of the parameters and get good suitable characteristic. In the Fuzzy-Controller to satisfy the control characteristics of the parameters there is special ability and that is to provide an easy computing, to control for Motor.

The identification of plant images in the field of computer vision has become an interdisciplinary focus. Taking benign conditions of quick advancement in computer vision and deep learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNN) approach is taken into consideration to learn feature representation of 185 classes of leaves taken from Columbia University, the University of Maryland, and the Smithsonian Institution. For the large-scale classification of plants in the natural environment, a 50-layer deep residual learning framework consisting of 5 stages is designed. The proposed model achieves a recognition rate of 93.09 percent as the accuracy of testing on the LeafSnap dataset, illustrating that deep learning is a highly promising forestry technology."

A questionnaire-type survey was conducted and the responses of 385 employees were analyzed using structural equation modeling with a partial least squares approach. The results imply the following: 1) information-possessing innovativeness (IPI) as the DSI factor influences employees’ U-LE; 2) interface convenience (IC) and interface design aesthetics (IDA), as system implementation factors, significantly affect U-LE; 3) imagery significantly influences U-LE; and 4) imagery is also proven to exert mediating effects on the relationships between U-LE and its antecedents by the bootstrapping method. Finally, both research and practice implications are discussed."

abstract = "Context
As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine – Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain.
Objective
We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware.
Method
Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation.
Results
Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection.
Conclusion
The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain."

Thus, it is critical to propose a new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled heterogeneous networks, including various terminal networks, fogs and clouds. Derived from cognitive science and data analytics, cognitive computing can mimic or augment human intelligence. When such cognitive intelligence is integrated with communications, traditional services will be renovated with higher accuracy and lower latency. In this paper, we propose cognition-based communications, which originates from both AI-based intelligent computing and advances in communications. Then, we introduce two applications of cognition-based communications, including user-centric cognitive communications, and cognitive internet of vehicles. Through cognition-based communications, we can better meet users’ needs, provide them with a higher Quality of Experience (QoE), and achieve higher energy efficiency."

The most critical requirements in developing a reliable face recognition algorithm is a large database of facial images and a well-developed systematic procedure to evaluate the system. In this paper, we bring out an approach to implement quick facial recognition using the concept of vocabulary trees in accordance with ORB, SIFT and SURF detectors and compare their performance. The model is trained using the Grimace, Face95 and ORL databases. The experiments are conducted by employing various state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and the results are compared for accuracy. The results and comparisons obtained on the databases show that the ORB detector clustered using Spectral clustering algorithm to construct the Vocabulary Tree outperforms the other techniques."

However, there is a lack of common references and structured protocols for the assessment of workers’ experience in industrial practices in an effective and predictive way. As a result, designers are poorly supported in the application of digital technologies, which are demonstrating to have a great potential. This ascertainment suggested defining a reference model to analyse the so-called user experience (UX) of workers and a proper technological set-up based on virtual simulations in order to support human-centred product-process design. Indeed, the recent advances in ubiquitous computing, wearable technologies and low-cost connected devices offer a huge amount of new tools for human data monitoring. However, the open issue is selecting the most proper devices for industrial application area in respect with design goals, using virtual simulation and digital manufacturing tools. The research proposed a structured procedure to use existing digital technologies to support product-process design to analyse the workers behaviours and assess the perceived experience for industrial scopes. The paper defined a structured protocol analysis to objectify and measure the workers’ experience with the final aim to support the requirements definition in product-process design by using digital technologies. In particular, the model has been defined for the automotive sector. The paper contribution is the definition of the protocol analysis and the development of a mixed reality (MR) set-up to involve real users’ and to improve the digital models. Such a protocol has been applied to different industrial cases related to product and process design, developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial. The comparison with traditional design procedures highlighted the benefits of adopting virtual mock-up and digital simulation within a MR environment to shorten design time and improve the design overall quality."

To study such complex phenomena and transformations, the paper emphasises that research should not only adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, but it also needs to follow an anti-disciplinary thinking whereby new knowledge and constructs do not simply fall within existing paradigms, disciplinary silos and mindsets once developed by studying the ‘pure’ humans and their behaviours."

Most of the recently proposed schemes are vulnerable to one or more security attacks and are inefficient in terms of processing time. In this paper, the scheme proposed by Xue et al. has been reviewed and it has been found that the scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack, stolen smart card attack, server spoofing attack. This paper proposes a robust and efficient password based authentication scheme which is secure against all well known security attacks.

We show that the number of places visited by each person (Points of Interest – PoIs) is regulated by some properties that are statistically similar among individuals. Subsequently, we present a PoIs classification in terms of their relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the PoIs relevance, we also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter, existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the semantic of PoIs. This is useful for deriving statistics on people’s habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of PoIs distribution and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the nature of the dataset in use. We illustrate that our approach is able to effectively extract a rich set of features describing human mobility and we argue that this can be seminal to novel mobility research."

Nowadays, the heterogeneity of interconnected things and communication technologies creates several small worlds composed of a single object and a smartphone. For each object, the user needs to download a specific application, search and connect the device. The result is a waste of valuable resources: several objects are able to communicate with the smartphone, but they cannot directly interact among them. In this paper, we propose a model that can be used to define a set of standard interfaces suitable for every smart object. Devices that adhere to the same model can be easily controlled and placed in relation among them, creating multi-object behaviors for a smart space. The smartphone is still a control center, but with a single application it is possible to control and personalize spaces in a holistic way, instead of using the traditional one-to-one approach. Moreover, personalization should be portable: it is desirable that a behavior works in as many smart spaces as possible, at least in a similar way as it does in the environment in which it was configured, freeing the user from the tedious task of adapting it manually every time s/he goes to another space. A portable personalization extends the bring your own device paradigm to a new “bring your own space” paradigm. The model is inspired in the object-oriented programming, reinterpreting features such as inheritance and polymorphism to the real world, so it is possible to provide a software system able to adapt existing behaviors to new spaces. The use of the model is exemplified in the paper with two examples of smart spaces."

The way in which this information is presented, and especially when it is presented, may make it difficult for the intensivists within intense healthcare units to understand a patient's state in a timely fashion. Should there be a need to cross various types of clinical data from various sources, the situation worsens considerably. To support the health professional's decision-making process, the Pervasive Business Intelligence (PBI) Systems are a forthcoming field. Based on this principle, the current study approaches the way to present information about the patients, after they are received in a BI system, making them available at any place and at any time for the intensivists that may need it for the decision-making. The patient's history will, therefore, be available, allowing examination of the vital signs data, what medicine that they might need, health checks performed, among others. Then, it is of vital importance, to make these conclusions available to the health professionals every time they might need, so as to aid them in the decision-making. This study aims to make a stance by approaching the theme of PBI in Critical Healthcare. The main objective is to understand the underlying concepts and the assets of BI solutions with Pervasive characteristics.

This algorithmic protocol acts intelligently as a privacy preserving model and technique to ensure the users data are kept more secretly and develop an endorsed trust on providers. We also explore the highest necessity to maintain the confidentiality of cloud user’s data."

A variety of state-of-the-art computing devices that are compatible with each other have been produced. These devices have the ability to interact with people. This is also known as pervasive computing. Particularly, as smartphones have recently become one of the most popular devices worldwide, various convenient applications are being released. Smartphones available today not only provide the ordinary internal processes such as dialing or receiving phone calls, sending text messages, and doing mobile banking, but also increasingly control various other devices that are part of our daily lives. In effect, this means that through smartphone applications, we can remotely control a variety of external devices such as televisions, projectors for presentations, computers, and even cars. The research in this paper is based on the evolving technological possibilities of using smartphone applications to control external devices. This paper presents the design and implementation of a remote lock system using wireless communication on a smartphone. In this context, remote lock system refers to a lock system that can be controlled remotely by a dedicated Android application. Every smartphone is equipped with Bluetooth which makes this technology possible. The application proposed in this paper uses the existing Bluetooth function on Android smartphones to open and manage locks. The users’ lock information can be stored and managed in real time in the database via a server that is built and managed by a server manager. Even if users forget the password of the lock, our proposed lock system can guide them to retrieve it easily, and a user manual is included to help users navigate the system. This system also provides a variety of management functions such as adding, deleting, modifying, and purchasing the user’s own locks."

However, this expansion results a data and information overflow making the handling of the access to the exact needed information more and more complex. This fact explains the need for a contextual access to the information and more generally to the knowledge set in the factory. Based on some fundamentals derived from ubiquitous computing paradigm, this paper proposes an approach to handle contextual access to the manufacturing knowledge."

In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation."

This new scenario calls for strong secure and resilient visual query mechanisms for these devices. In this work we propose an innovative secure visual search system, which is well-suited for ubiquitous computing scenarios empowered by modern smart personal devices. More precisely, we show how to insert, at the visual data acquisition time, a watermark inside the already compressed descriptor characterizing an MPEG-CDVS data stream used in visual queries, to make it possible to decode the watermark on the server side in order to improve the robustness against image-based identity spoofing. Such a security enforcement solution may be practical in several real-life applications involving visual queries performed from personal trusted devices, and it is particularly suitable in all those application domains that require performing visual queries with a high degree of security. It has been extensively tested and achieved satisfactory results: the presence of such a watermark does not affect the image matching performance and functionality."

Its applications are everywhere, supporting users in everyday activities in a transparent way with little or no need for attention.

To do that, measurements can be applied to obtain data about quality characteristics in a software product. In a previous study about quality characteristics and software measures for ubiquitous computing, we have identified a gap in the literature regarding software measures for evaluating essential quality characteristics in ubiquitous systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a suite of well-defined software measures (twenty-four in total), called AQUArIUM, to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) in ubiquitous applications for mobile devices. These measures address five quality characteristics of ubiquitous computing: Context-awareness, Mobility, Attention, Calmness and Transparency. The proposed suite was validated theoretically and empirically. The results showed not only that the suite is feasible, but also that it indicates specific problems of HCI quality, which are helpful in improving the evaluated ubiquitous mobile application."

Furthermore, traffic infrastructure is realized using global and local computing devices. Communication initiated by the car itself (e.g., to an emergency hotline) will be obligatory in some countries soon. And finally, by using a smart phone the driver brings an additional powerful computing device and sensor set to the vehicle. However, all these automotive sensors and computing devices are used just for fixed (and in most cases single) purposes. Data exchange between vehicles or vehicles and infrastructure is rarely done. And dynamic changes like compensating for a broken sensor with available other data, using old sensor equipment for new functions, or improving old driver assistance systems with new sensors is not possible, either. The objective of the collaborative research project Smart Adaptive Data Aggregation (SADA) is to develop technologies that enable linking data from distributed mobile on-board sensors (on vehicles) with data from previously unknown stationary (e.g., infrastructure) or mobile sensors (e.g., other vehicles, smart devices). One focus of the project is the dynamic and fully-automated switching between different sensors or sensor configurations, including the adaptation of data fusion processes. Technically, one important component for some of the SADA use cases is a central backend system that (1) collects sensor data of the vehicles and/or the infrastructure, (2) fuses these data, and (3) carries out machine learning (ML) based analysis of the data to generate new information for the drivers (sometimes refered to by the term “virtual sensors”). The article gives a short overview of the SADA project and describes in more detail the concept of the backend system architec- ture, the user interface, and the methods and processes needed for a demonstration use-case."

abstract = "As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain–computer interfacing, cyber–physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing."

UDSS enables decision makers to access mobile networks to acquire information at anytime, anywhere. However, there have been few studies investigating why UDSS users intend to use the systems continuously, as there would be a large number of elements to take into consideration. The specific factors of the UDSS that this study focuses on include the connectivity and context-awareness function, which were not considered in previous research on the adoption of UDSS. Accordingly, this study empirically explores this research question by using the scanphone-based ubiquitous delivery system (UDS), which many delivery service providers have been adopting recently as a form of the ubiquitous decision support system (UDSS). The results reveal that connectivity, context-awareness function, and perceived values play meaningful roles in the UDSS. Based on these results, this study suggests implications and directions for future research to enable the planning and realization of the future UDSS."

The proposed approach stands out by the design of a repository that supports three database models and by the compositional processing strategy based on rules. In our proposal, the applications can combine data stored on different bases in a single rule, which could enhance the identification of contextual situations. For the evaluation we designed and implemented some case studies on information security area, exploring the hybrid repository composed of relational, non-relational, and triple storage models. Our results demonstrate that was possible to identify richer situations with the data composition across more than one model and there are situations that can only be found through this composition."

However, the direct interaction smart devices often have with the physical world, along with the processing, storage and communication of data pertaining to users’ lives, i.e. private sensitive in nature, bring security concerns into the limelight. The resource-constraints of the platforms being integrated into a smart home environment, and their heterogeneity in hardware, network and overlaying technologies, only exacerbate the above issues.

abstract = "Context
A smart-space SS typically consists of many rooms, with temperature and humidity environment attributes, devices, and software components that communicate with each other to satisfy certain test purposes that need to be checked over various realistic exterior environment weather conditions.
Objective
We present a novel energy-aware approach for the validation of smart-spaces while minimizing the energy consumption encountered during testing.
Method
A framework for deriving minimal (energy) cost tests is provided. It includes SS, a controlled environment Env that depicts the exterior conditions, and a Tester that can control SS and Env, derive and runs tests, and observe relevant SS attributes in order to release a success verdict whenever a test purpose is met. A simulator is proposed for deriving tests by appropriately exploring part of the SS behavior employing several cost functions for computing the estimated cost and duration of test events.
Results
The framework is deployed in a real SS environment which is used to assess the actual energy consumption of derived tests in practice. Experiments show that the actual power consumption of the derived tests is close to the ones estimated by the simulator.

HAR relies on the machine learning models trained using sufficient activity data. However, when the labels from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) are missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help recognize the activities of this position? This problem can be divided into two steps. Firstly, when there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. Secondly, with the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains in order to recognize the activities on the target domain. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a Stratified Transfer Learning (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and activity transfer. STL is based on our proposed Stratified distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: 1) Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS), which can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; and 2) Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT), which is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL."

This is a challenging problem because of the stream nature of data, the complexity and changing nature of contexts. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model for the detection of co-location contexts from Bluetooth signals. By using an Indian buffet process as the prior distribution, the model can discover the number of contexts automatically. We introduce a novel fixed-lag particle filter that processes data incrementally. This sampling scheme is especially suitable for pervasive computing as the computational requirements remain constant in spite of growing data. We examine our model on a synthetic dataset and two real world datasets. To verify the discovered contexts, we compare them to the communities detected by the Louvain method, showing a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. Fixed-lag particle filter is compared with Gibbs sampling in terms of the normalized factorization error that shows a close performance between the two inference methods. As fixed-lag particle filter processes a small chunk of data when it comes and does not need to be restarted, its execution time is significantly shorter than that of Gibbs sampling."

The technique, termed Non-intrusive Identity Assertion System (NIAS), uses knowledge of how the user uses the environment’s services to infer their identity. The technique monitors user behaviour through identifying certain types of activity without the need for detailed tracking of user behaviour, thus minimising intrusion on the user’s normal activities. The technique was evaluated using a simulated environment to assess its reliability. Simulation results show that the technique can be applied in various situations such as strict and relaxed security settings by applying different security policies. They also show that the technique is particularly effective where the environment has a mixture of high and low security resources in which case reliability could exceed 99%."

To connect such different models, we propose a framework for managing context-aware services executed at pervasive computing and cloud computing. The framework is constructed as a world model for specifying contextual information in the real world. This paper describes the design and prototype implementation of the proposed model."

Ubiquitous computing provides any services anywhere and anytime through networks conveniently to improve the quality of life of users. Ubiquitous computing is constructed via a variety of invisible sensors, networks, and computing environments. For multi-purpose sensors, deployment of the topology and topology lifetime are very important depending on wired or wireless sensors. Uneven energy consumption due to integrated routing sensors according to topology deployment types is a factor that degrades the quality of service (QoS) about user convenience services and lifetime of total topology. As a result, a number of studies on maximization of topology lifetime have been conducted. However, previous studies focused on deployment environments and limited sensors so that they cannot be deployed to real sites. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive power management scheme (APMS) that manages sensor power adaptively according to deployment environments to maximize topology lifetime. The APMS maximizes topology lifetime by changing routing paths according to lifetime log to manage sensor power. Furthermore, active responses for optimum topology can be achieved by deploying sensors via simulation prior to sensors deployed to the real environments by users."

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper."

This paper analyses and consolidates the literature in order to identify the key aspects of this new phenomenon. We have coined the term “eObjects”1 for the central element of the “third wave”. The paper presents a framework for research into the technologies and their implications, distinguishing core from common attributes, and identifying categories of inter-device interaction. A subsequent paper will apply the research framework to legal research, with the intention of understanding areas in which litigation can be anticipated, and uncovering areas where the law may not adequately deal with emergent social and business practices."

We propose a self-adaptive pervasive fall detection approach that is robust to the heterogeneity of real life situations.

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution."

Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) seeks to overcome the issues by following the idea of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The CaaS delivery model attempts to separate context service consumers from context service providers. However, CaaS shifts the complexities of context service provisioning and management from consumers toward providers. Considering the merits of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in coping with the complexities of problems in different domains, we leverage MDD in the CaaS domain and propose the CaaSSET framework to ease the development of context services. A prerequisite for realizing this aim is to specify the CaaS domain as a meta-model. Our CaaSSET framework consists of a CaaS reference model, a context service meta-model, a graphical modeling tool, a code generation tool, and a context service management tool. Using CaaSSET, the context services are modeled in a graphical environment and transformed into executable context web services (semi-) automatically. To evaluate the applicability of the CaaSSET framework, we have modeled and developed a tourism context service as a case study. We have also compared the framework with the related work based on 44 evaluation criteria, which we have extracted from 14 context service requirements."

Due to the technological nature of ubiquitous services, previous experience alters the way in which potential users face these services.

With TYDR, we track a larger variety of smartphone data than similar existing apps, including metadata on notifications, photos taken, and music played back by the user. For the development of TYDR, we introduce a general context data model consisting of four categories that focus on the user’s different types of interactions with the smartphone: physical conditions and activity, device status and usage, core functions usage, and app usage. On top of this, we develop the privacy model PM-MoDaC specifically for apps related to the collection of mobile data, consisting of nine proposed privacy measures. We present the implementation of all of those measures in TYDR. Although the utilization of the user’s personality based on the usage of his or her smartphone is a challenging endeavor, it seems to be a promising approach for various types of context-aware mobile applications."

abstract = "Human beings with smart devices have dramatically facilitated the knowledge acquisition in ubiquitous computing systems. However, the collected contents also severely threat the security and privacy for individuals, as these contents achieve a fine-grained coverage of one’s behaviors and movements. Local differential privacy, as one of the widely accepted properties, enables individuals to contribute to data collection while remaining indistinguishable against adversaries. However, existing solutions and mechanisms fail to capture the contents with relatively low frequency, e.g., the temperature in local regions visited by very few people. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for distinct content estimation under local differential privacy. We propose a hash function and random response based framework for the estimation. The framework allows individuals in the ubiquitous computing system to participate with flexible bandwidth, and properly assigns the given bandwidth to improve estimated results. We prove the optimization problem of assignment in our framework to be NP-complete, and provides an effective heuristic algorithm. Our framework is also proved to guarantee an unbiased estimation for distinct contents, and achieves local differential privacy for users. Meanwhile, we also propose a randomized algorithm designed for more general cases, where the preposed knowledge for the first algorithm is unavailable. Finally, we evaluate both algorithms on real world datasets, and the results reveal that our algorithms outperform existing methods."

The approach is to focus on presenting functionality in a GUI rather than attaching functionality to manually added components. We see this as an inverted way of working with GUI development. The solution was realized in the form of a graphical editor for a PalCom specific User Interface Description Language. The tool produces platform independent GUI descriptions that can be interpreted on any platform. When compared to another common tool, the presented editor exhibited roughly 10x shorter development times. The learning time for new users was also evaluated with positive outcome, and a scalability evaluation showed that the solution can be used to create professional grade GUIs."

In an ageing world population more citizens are at risk of cognitive impairment, with negative consequences on their ability of independent living, quality of life and sustainability of healthcare systems. Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective.
Methods
A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level.
Results
We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates."

Context-aware applications need to react and adapt to changes in their computing environment, which is in general ubiquitous and inherently distributed. Therefore, the context communication faces the problem of context representations heterogeneity, the limitation of devices capacity and network bandwidth. In order to overcome this challenging issue, a particular management of the context is required either for its collection, update, and exchange. In this paper, we propose an approach to manage the context in ubiquitous environments based on the semantic representation of the context and its update using standard languages such as RDF and RDF(s). Our proposed approach provides the simplicity and flexibility that allow the developer to express the context without the need for a unified context model. The results of the experimentation carried out using a prototype implementation of a middleware supports the proposed approach, are in favour of using our approach in the case of resource-constrained devices and network."

In pervasive computing environment, the combination of ubiquitous overlay networks and the capacity of multihoming can provide the possibility of exploiting plentiful available paths. Thus, we introduce a Pervasive Multipath Architecture (PEMA), in which we use the game theory to investigate the selfish strategic collaboration of multiple heterogeneous overlays when they are allowed to use the massively-multipath transfer. Overlay networks are modeled as “players” in this multipath selection game, and we study the asymmetric case where all overlays have different Round Trip Times (RTT) and different degrees of waste. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE). In addition, we find that overlays differing only in their RTTs still receive proportional throughput shares and utilities at the NE. However, if overlays differ only in their degrees of waste, a more wasteful overlay has a larger utility and a larger throughput (bandwidth) share than a less wasteful overlay. Since maintaining connected paths consumes resource, we further consider a more generalized cost function where an overlay’s total resource consumption includes both transferring data packets and maintaining path connections. In this general game, we find that the overlay is more conservative, which opens smaller number of paths and obtains smaller efficiency loss at the NE than in other simplified games. Our simulations confirm the effectiveness and friendliness of multipath transfer for a range of path numbers and in the presence of multi-overlay traffic."

Pervasive computing applications can be formulated on top of the IoT involving nodes that can interact with their environment and perform various processing tasks. Any task is part of intelligent services executed in nodes or the back end infrastructure for supporting end users’ applications. In this setting, one can identify the need for applying updates in the software/firmware of the autonomous nodes. Updates are extensions or patches significant for the efficient functioning of nodes. Legacy methodologies deal with centralized approaches where complex protocols are adopted to support the distribution of the updates in the entire network. In this paper, we depart from the relevant literature and propose a distributed model where each node is responsible to, independently, initiate and conclude the update process. Nodes monitor a set of metrics related to their load and the performance of the network and through a time-optimized scheme identify the appropriate time to conclude the update process. We report on an infinite horizon optimal stopping model on top of the collected performance data. The aim is to make nodes capable of identifying when their performance and the performance of the network are of high quality to efficiently conclude the update process. We provide specific formulations and the analysis of the problem while extensive simulations and a comparison assessment reveal the advantages of the proposed solution."

abstract = "With the development of sensing, wireless communication, and Internet technologies, we are now living in a world that is filled with various smart things – the Internet of Things (IOT). This paper introduces and prospects an emerging research area – the Embedded Intelligence (EI). This field aims at revealing the individual behaviours, spatial contexts, as well as social patterns and urban dynamics by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting with Internet of smart things (cameras, smart cars, smart cards, etc). In the agricultural sector we add mining of existing technology (books, articles, blue prints) to generate high depth ontologies or metadata and knowledge extraction from Big Data for reasoning and making pro-active decisions using open data information. We include intelligent data analysis to discover new knowledge from data records. The paper discusses the research history, characteristics, general architecture, major applications, and research issues of EI and exemplifies an application of the team in IOT smart irrigation. The purpose of presenting it as a Technology Roadmap (TRM) was to clarify the challenges and opportunities in the general area of “Intelligent Building Technologies” (IBT) and more specifically to smart greenhouses, smart irrigation, or smart crop management. The understanding of smart agriculture is important to be identified by the scientific community as a significant issue because it is needed for nations to develop and adopt these emerging technologies. Global interoperability is of key importance, and so it is a common understanding of values such as privacy and security, based on open, fair and transparent international standards."

Nodes are capable of interacting each other and/or collect/process huge volumes of ambient data. Any service or application executed on top of the collected data is hosted by the operating software/firmware of nodes, thus, such software should be up-to-date. Legacy techniques dealing with the update task cannot efficiently support it due to the adopted centralized approach that suffers from a number of disadvantages. In this paper, we go a step forward and propose a time-optimized and network performance-aware model for initiating and concluding the update process. Our aim is to have the nodes independently deciding the initiation of the update process by finding the appropriate time to execute it. Every node acts autonomously and monitors the network's performance to find a slot where performance parameters advocate for an efficient and uninterrupted conclusion of the update task. Hence, the proposed model can be adapted to the environment and the status of each node. The final decision is made taking into consideration multiple parameters and it is based on the solution of the widely known Secretary Problem (SP) originated in the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST). We provide the description of the problem, specific formulations and the analysis of our solution while extensive experiments reveal the advantages of the proposed scheme."

Although this works well in lab environments, where one middleware manages all resources, this will not suffice in real-world deployments, where more than one system software is present and services as well as other resources are only accessible by those. In this paper, we present XWARE, an interoperability framework that allows to integrate discovery and interaction of different middleware platforms. The flexible design allows to configure and extend the interoperability framework in order to add new platforms and tailor it for the use in different domains. Furthermore, XWARE instances can communicate with each other enabling interoperability in smart environments as well as in smart peer groups. The feasibility of our approach is discussed and evaluated based on the integration of five different platforms."

So far, many of PDs do not provide a means of interaction acting only act as output devices that present information. On the other hand, smartphones have become increasingly popular due to their number of users, inherent properties and power. It has been argued that digital information is required for most meetings, whether formal or informal. With technological improvement and the growing of the ubiquity of both PDs and smartphones, streaming data between devices should be done smoothly in formal or informal meetings. While many possibilities exist for communication between such devices, file sharing in these scenarios is still restricted. These solutions also focus only on new mechanisms for interaction with PDs and ignore PDs’ primary function of displaying information. To solve this problem, we present a novel technique that allows users to transfer different types of files while preserving the security of these files. The technique will be particularly used to transfer files from smartphones to PDs in various kinds of meetings. The system combines both traditional uses of PDs (such as displaying announcements) and interactive ways of giving real-time presentations by uploading files, marking important parts of pages and writing notes. The findings imply that a majority of users are ready to use the system. Furthermore, the systems's performance evaluation results are very encouraging and reveal that the deployed tool is an effective method that can be a reasonable alternative to using projectors."

In order to help designers on this engineering process, we propose in this paper a roadmap on context management and a requirements elicitation process. This roadmap aims at sharing with non-expert designers the necessary expertise on context management allowing them to better understand the notion of context and its challenges.

We first frame the various dimensions along which nature-inspired coordination models can be defined, and survey the most relevant proposals in the area. We describe the nature-inspired coordination model developed within the SAPERE project as a synthesis of existing approaches, and show how it can effectively support the multifold requirements of modern and emerging pervasive services. We conclude by identifying what we think are the open research challenges in this area, and identify some research directions that we believe are promising."

Semantic Web technologies provide a uniform framework for capturing these properties. Offering powerful representation facilities and reasoning techniques, these technologies are rapidly gaining attention towards facing a range of issues such as data and knowledge modelling, querying, reasoning, service discovery, privacy and provenance. This article reviews the application of the Semantic Web to pervasive and sensor-driven systems with a focus on information modelling and reasoning along with streaming data and uncertainty handling. The strengths and weaknesses of current and projected approaches are analysed and a roadmap is derived for using the Semantic Web as a platform, on which open, standard-based, pervasive, adaptive and sensor-driven systems can be deployed."

We offer three primary axes through which a categorisation of multiplicitous media forms can be framed: substrate versus object; composed versus self-organised, and homogeneous versus heterogeneous. We also analyse how the number of elements in the multiplicities (from tens to tens of thousands and beyond) affects the qualities of the experience."

Obfuscation techniques are desirable in reducing the impact of disclosing confidential information but with a significant loss of utility of information content. Thus, accesses to confidential data by mobile users need to be controlled so as to minimize the disclosure risks. To achieve these requirements, we propose a novel location-dependent disclosure risk based decision support framework for persistent authentication and data access management. We have derived the location dependent identity based disclosure risks at record level and file level by using the search theory and entropy. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed model using multi-level security model and fuzzy sets. We have further proved that our proposed technique can significantly reduce the impact of common privacy attacks by performing a comprehensive security analysis. In conclusion, this research presents a novel location-dependent disclosure risk-based decision support framework persistent authentication and a pragmatic data access management approach for highly privacy-sensitive pervasive computing applications."

In this article, we reflect on the ways in which ideas of animal-centric development may impact the development of technology for animals in practice. We start by looking at the process of development for and with animals, and propose a development model facilitating the principles of Agility, Welfare of Animals, and eXperts’ involvement (AWAX) within the development lifecycle. While promoting the animal-centric approach, it is important to acknowledge that an animal usually uses technology through humans and in a particular environment. We further extend the AWAX model to include considerations of the human in the loop and the environment, and discuss some practical implications of this view, including aspects such as security and privacy."

Recent models consider this behavior as a combination of both social and spatial factors. Yet, establishing accurate traces of human groups is difficult: current techniques capture either positions, or contacts, with a limited accuracy. In this paper we introduce a new technique to capture such behaviors. The interest of this approach lies in the unprecedented accuracy at which both positions and orientations of humans, even gathered in a crowd, are captured. The open-source software pipeline we developed to exploit captured data allows extraction of several metrics on movement and social contacts, and permits study of their respective interrelationship. From the mobility to the topological connectivity, this framework offers a layered approach that can be tailored, allowing to compare and reason about models and traces. We demonstrate the accuracy and validity of our approach on social events and calibration runs in which we captured the motions of humans. In particular, we introduce an open-access trace of 50 individuals and compare it against random waypoint models that have the same global characteristics. Our fine-grain analyses, that take into account social interactions between users, show that the random way point model does not provide accurate predictions for socially-induced motion; to model human kinetics, new group- and interaction-based models should be developed. From the computer science point of view, these models are required to fully exploit the power of human-centered mobile computing, crucial for ubiquitous computing, and referred to as Short Range Communication Systems, Mobile Opportunistic Networking, or Mobile Networking in Proximity."

It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies."

abstract = "Pervasive social systems often take advantage of geographical information to provide real-time information to users based on their location. However, due to privacy concerns, many social media users do not share their exact geographical coordinates. In this paper, we describe our technique that predicts locations of posts that are not associated with explicit coordinates, a process called geolocation. Existing research has utilized the content of a post as well as the post author’s social media relationships with other users to estimate location. Our research provides a novel approach to geolocation by combining multiple techniques, as well as adding a new technique: estimating location by clustering similar social media posts that are centered in a geographical area."

Research works of cryptography methods aim to protect the data in the ubiquitous computing and communication systems by encryption. However, more and more recent incidents threatening data security have shown that sole encryption schemes cannot meet the safety needs in today’s complicated ubiquitous computing systems. Thus, the topic of providing additional protection such as All-Or-Nothing (AON) data protection scheme has drawn interest from a large number of researchers and practitioners. Many data protection methods based on this AON data protection concepts are developed aiming to enhance the classical encryption schemes. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we collate research works across a number of topics in AON, from historical developments to the recent research proposal. By introducing new definitions and category methods, we hope to provide useful reference and perspectives for the state of AON research and development."

The management and prevention of these diseases can be done by controlling the behavioral and biological risk factors which are related to them. ChronicPrediction is an intelligent system for noncommunicable diseases care which determines in real time the impact on risk factors due to actions taken by users. Based on impact information, the system presents on users’ smartphones strategic messages to help in their treatment. ChronicPrediction applies Bayesian Networks (BNs) which use risk factors for mapping the causes of noncommunicable diseases worsening. The support to multiple chronic diseases and the integrated use of multiple BNs based on risk factors are the main contributions of this work and differentiate the proposed system from related work. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first one successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ChronicPrediction to support BNs based on risk factors and the sending of messages to users’ smartphones. The evaluation involved the building of a BN for predicting coronary artery disease made with real world data obtained in a prospective cohort study. The study involved 302 patients from a hospital localized in southern Brazil. The second experiment assessed the ChronicPrediction support to multiple BNs at same time. The test involved the previous BN and another from a thirty part research work to map risk factors of diabetes. The results were encouraging and show potential for implementing ChronicPrediction in real-life situations."

abstract = "Context
Context-aware software systems can interact with different devices to complete their tasks and act according to the context, regardless of their development and organizational differences. Interoperability is a big challenge in the engineering of such systems.
Objective
To discuss how interoperability has been addressed in context-aware software systems, strengthening the scientific basis for its understanding and conceptualization.
Method
A quasi-systematic literature review was undertaken to observe interoperability in such context-aware software systems to support the discussions. Its dataset includes 17 from 408 papers identified in the technical literature. The extracted information was qualitatively analyzed by following the principles of Grounded Theory.
Results
The analysis allowed to identify ten interoperability concepts, organized into a Theoretical Framework according to structural and behavioral perspectives, which deals with interoperability as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage interaction with a system) to interact for a particular purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome. Once the interoperability is established from structural concepts (context, perspective, purpose, the level of provided support and system attributes), it can be measured, improved and observed from the behavioral concepts (evaluation method, challenges, issues, and benefits).
Conclusions
The Interoperability Theoretical Framework provides relevant information to organize the knowledge related to interoperability, considering context, and can be used to guide the evolution of software systems regarding changes focused on interoperability."

However, it still presents a number of challenges, both for the full implementation of technologies and for the integration with existing information systems. One of the main mismatches evidenced by recent works is how context-awareness, a widely used capability in ubiquitous computing and actual information systems with relational databases may be integrated to allow ubiquitous and traditional systems to query relational data sources without the necessity to modify the schema of the database. This paper presents an integration model relating context and domain information allowing relational data to be retrieved in context without the necessity to change the originally used relational queries. A set of linking rules and algorithms are formalized in a model and this model is implemented in a prototype. The evaluation of the model is performed by applying it in a case study in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. The evaluation of the model by the application of it in a case study in a MOOC platform demonstrated the possibility to use an ontology frequently used in ubiquitous middleware as an extra filtering layer for information systems without the necessity to recreate queries or make a re-engineering in the relational database schema. The results of the queries after the application of the model showed an average decrease of 21% in returned tuples, which was evaluated as a significant reduce in tuple results."

Currently, most sensor-based activity recognition techniques rely on supervised learning algorithms. However, the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities in smart homes is expensive and violates the individual’s privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel hybrid approach that couples collaborative active learning with probabilistic and knowledge-based reasoning. The rationale of our approach is that a generic, and possibly incomplete, knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method exploiting users’ feedback to (i) refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology, and (ii) mine temporal patterns of sensor events that are frequently generated by the execution of specific activities. A Markov Logic Network is used to recognize activities with probabilistic rules that capture both the ontological knowledge and the information obtained by active learning. We experimented our solution with a real-world dataset of activities carried out by several individuals in an interleaved fashion. Experimental results show that our collaborative and personalized active learning solution significantly improves recognition rates, while triggering a small number of feedback requests. Moreover, the overall recognition rates compare favorably with existing supervised and unsupervised activity recognition methods."

With this “energy wise” approach, battery-less and contact-less communication nodes are becoming increasingly attractive for future pervasive computing. In this paper, we study important design considerations and technical limitations for realizing such a device, and then we propose D2ART (Direct Data Accessing from Passive RFID Tag) that not only performs as a normal passive RFID tag for identification, but also provides rich information such as multimedia to a reader with extreme low power consumption. Our fabricated D2ART IC is operational within 7–8 cm at data transmission rate of 5 Mbps by interfacing with a conventional flash memory according to the measurement and post-layout simulation results with reasonable assumptions."

Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human–(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the “ICT biographies” of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging ICT users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy ICT users in relation to younger “generations”, for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on ICT and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing ICT practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography?"

To achieve this vision, interoperability among heterogeneous systems represents a key enabler, and mediators are often built to solve protocol mismatches. Many approaches propose the synthesis of mediators. Unfortunately, a rigorous characterization of the concept of interoperability is still lacking, hence making hard to assess their applicability and soundness. In this paper, we provide a framework for the synthesis of mediators that allows us to: (i) characterize the conditions for the mediator existence and correctness; and (ii) establish the applicability boundaries of the synthesis method."

abstract = "In pervasive/ubiquitous computing environments, interacting users may evaluate their respective trustworthiness by using historical data coming from their past interactions. Nevertheless, when two users are at the first interaction, they have no historical data involving their own activities to be analyzed, and then use information (recommender-data) provided by other users (recommenders) who, in the past, have had interactions with one of the involved parties. Although this approach has proven to be effective, it might fail if dishonest recommenders provide unfair recommender-data. Indeed, such unfair data may lead to skewed evaluations, and therefore either increase the trustworthiness of a malicious user or reduce the one of a honest user in a fraudulent way. In this work, we propose an algorithm for identifying false recommender-data. Our attention is explicitly focused on recommender-data rather than recommenders. This because some recommenders could provide recommender-data containing only a limited (but specific) set of altered information. This is used by dishonest recommenders as a tactic to avoid being discovered. The proposed algorithm uses association rules to express a confidence-based measure (reputation rank), which is used as a reliability ranking of the recommender-data. The resulting approach has been compared with other existing ones in this field, resulting more accurate in finding out unfair recommender-data sent by dishonest recommenders."

abstract = "Many issues in the cloud can be transformed into optimization problems, where data is of high dimension and randomness. Thus, stochastic optimizing is a key to Autonomous Cloud. And one of the most significant discussions in this field is how to adapt the learning rate and convergent path dynamically. This paper proposes a gradient-based algorithm called Adacom, that is based on an adaptive control system and momentum. Critically inheriting the previous studies, a reference model is introduced to generate the update. The method reduces noise and decides on paths with less oscillation, while maintaining the accumulated learning rate. Due to system design properties, the method requires fewer hyper-parameters for tuning. We state the prospect of Adacom as a general optimizer in Autonomous Cloud, and explore the potential of Adacom for pervasive computing by the assumption of transition data. Then we demonstrate the convergence of Adacom theoretically. The evaluations over the simulated transition data prove the feasibility and superiority of Adacom with other gradient-based methods."
