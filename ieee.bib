  abstract={With the increases in mobile usage, data sensors and IoT devices the classical Cloud approach encounters a lot of problems in network congestion and in the response speed. A method for optimizing the communication between the devices and the cloud is to place the computing power in the proximity of sources. Edge Computing is a paradigm that proposes data processing and storage at the edge of the network. For the Mobile Edge Computing, the edge is represented by pervasive Radio Access Networks. Edge computing addresses a variety of applications and use cases. For instance, edge model can be used in Smart Cities, Cyber-physical infrastructures, Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks. In the model, the tasks and the data are submitted first on the gateway nodes, which are devices with computation and storage capabilities. In this way the latency is minimized, and the network bandwidth is preserved. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a novel decentralized storage system for Edge Computing paradigm aiming to provide a unified storage for data generated by different edge devices.},

  abstract={Computationally intensive tasks of IoT applications can be offloaded to powerful devices in the edge. Code offloading reduces energy consumption and increases performance. However, applications that use face recognition, machine learning, or image rendering, rely on large amounts of data. The transfer of this data leads to latencies which contradicts the responsiveness required by many pervasive applications. As a solution, decoupling the data from the tasks allows to apply new scheduling strategies that place data on remote devices before the actual task execution. Grid computing approaches use this technique effectively, however, edge computing introduces further challenges such as device fluctuation and heterogeneity.In this paper, we propose a data management approach for edge computing environments that decouples data placement from task scheduling. We present a multi-level scheduler, which places data on resource providers in the system considering multiple context dimensions. The scheduler allocates tasks according to the current context and observes the state during runtime. If required, the system adjusts the number of data copies to optimize the trade-off between execution latencies and data management overhead. The paper has three contributions: (1) a context-aware multi-level scheduler, (2) the integration of four data placement, three task scheduling, and three runtime adaptation algorithms, (3) an evaluation in a real-world testbed.},

  abstract={Existing pervasive computing applications entail high degrees of communication, but existing deployments by and large rely on either a backend Internet connection to support communication or provide only one-way distribution of data (e.g., via environmental beacons). However, the pervasiveness of sensing, computation, and communication has changed the landscape of potential pervasive crowd applications. The plain “chattiness” of our everyday environments opens broad new possibilities for pervasive computing devices to opportunistically leverage each other, where the potential capability of a whole opportunistic crowd is much larger than the sum of its individuals' capabilities. In this talk, I will present both concrete motivating application domains and technical capabilities and constraints that lead us to consider the potential of direct device-to-device collaboration in support of crowd applications in pervasive computing. Drawing on my group's work in collaborative, opportunistic context-awareness, I will create a roadmap for research in support of a future vision of opportunistic crowds.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the current trend in research is going towards the combination of the Cloud and Internet of Things. This interplay is referred to as Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT aimed to provide pervasive and ubiquitous computing, in which IoT capabilities are provisioned as services (e.g., sensing as a service) in an on-demand fashion. However, smart services that characterized as real-time and delay-sensitive require energy efficient CoT architectures. This paper surveys CoT architectures, platforms and the application of CoT in the context of healthcare. Moreover, the paper mainly emphasizes on investigating and discussing the most relevant energy efficiency proposals. The investigation of such works reveals that further efforts are still required to obtain energy-efficient CoT architectures, particularly in healthcare, in which the tradeoffs between energy efficiency, delay, and quality of service is considered.},

Existing frameworks such as Cloud computing simply utilize these IoT devices as end-to-end network gateways. Paradigms such as Edge and Fog computing while able to minimize latency by bringing computing devices nearer to the data source, fail to consider the utilization of computation resource of these IoT devices. For connectivity challenged environments such as rural or disaster areas, cloud and edge/fog systems are not as accessible and devices are limited to wireless sensor networks and cheap commodity computing nodes. The goal of our research is to deliver pervasive computing to these environments by developing a middleware for heterogeneous IoT devices. Utilizing the middleware enables IoT devices to perform distributed machine information processing on available sensor nodes, without Cloud-based computing resources.},

The edge computing network is driven by the development of cloud computing and the Internet of things, its core is to face the massive uplink monitoring and acquisition produced by the intelligent sensing equipment, and the downlink decision control big data. This paper solves the problem of low performance of data computing in a centralized cloud computing model through edge side big data storage and computing. Compared with the traditional cloud computing network, the edge computing network has more terminal types, more frequent real-time data exchange, more complex transmission network technology system, and a higher degree of intelligent interconnection of business systems. However, the edge computing network is ubiquitous, and the open characteristics transmit the network security risk to every business link of the system, which faces severe security protection challenges. This paper focuses on the requirements of high real-time and high continuity of edge computing networks, and faces the dual constraints of the hybrid characteristics of edge computing networks and the uncertainty of new network attack characteristics, the present situation of active defense technologies such as detection, circumvention, deception, control and so on for edge computing network is summarized before serious damage is caused by edge computing network.

  abstract={With consumers embracing the prevalence of ubiquitously connected smart devices, Edge Computing is emerging as a principal computing paradigm for latency-sensitive and in-proximity services. However, as the plethora of data generated across connected devices continues to vastly increase, the need to query the "edge" and derive in-time analytic insights is more evident than ever. This paper introduces our vision for a rich and declarative query model abstraction particularly tailored for the unique characteristics of Edge Computing and presents a prototype framework that realizes our vision. Towards this, the declarative query model enables users to express high-level and descriptive analytic insights, while our framework compiles, optimizes and executes the query plan decoupled from the programming model of the underlying data processing engine. Afterwards, we showcase a number of potential use-cases which stand to benefit from the realization of query-driven descriptive analytics for edge computing. We conclude by elaborating on the open challenges that still must be addressed to realize our vision and potential research opportunities for the academic community to further advance the current State-of-the-Art.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled unprecedented interactions with our physical world, with the aim to deliver a wide range of customizable services in many domains. With recent advancements in IoT technology, users are increasingly expecting these services to be intelligent and context aware. Nevertheless, there is still no framework capable of delivering personalized IoT services on a large scale. For such a framework to be conceived, it is likely that technologies from many domains have to be utilized. This paper examines the readiness of the leading state-of-the-art technologies in several key fields for realizing the goal of a truly scalable and personalized IoT experience. We discuss the important requirements and challenges for realizing this goal. Then, we identify the major approaches that can contribute to this goal and categorize them into: technologies for adaptive personalized sensing, scalable solutions for user-centric networking, and intelligence techniques that leverage context awareness and adaptability at the application and system levels. In the first category, our discussion centers around virtualization and reprogrammability at the sensing layer. In the second category, we investigate the readiness of Fog computing and information-centric networking to develop scalable personalized IoT infrastructures. These approaches were chosen for their combined ability to match dynamic user requirements with available system resources, while guaranteeing overall efficient utilization. Finally, in the third category, we examine context awareness, reasoning, and machine learning techniques as well as semantic technologies for realizing proactive and adaptive intelligent IoT systems and applications. This paper offers a focused discussion of the key topics that drive the research in the important and timely topic of scalable and personalized IoT networks.},

  abstract={Mobile devices, along with wearable sensors, allow patients to access healthcare services from anywhere at any time. The longstanding constraints of computational capability and storage space on mobile devices can be alleviated by outsourcing computation- or data-intensive tasks to remote cloud centers. Thus, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been recognized as a promising approach to provide pervasive healthcare services to people in their daily life. As the development and adoption of MCC techniques in healthcare, new optimization strategies have been explored and studied to help mobile cloud healthcare services to be deployed in a more effective and efficient manner. In this survey, we demonstrate how MCC techniques have been extensively deployed in various healthcare applications and, specifically, describe the general architecture and design considerations one should take into account while designing an MCC for healthcare scenarios. Given a large number of factors that may affect the performance of the MCC and even result in catastrophic consequences in healthcare, this paper presents the state-of-the-art optimization methods on the MCC for meeting the diverse priorities and achieving the optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives. Finally, the security and privacy issues of the MCC in healthcare are also discussed.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things promises to offer numerous societal benefits by providing a spectrum of user applications. However, ethical ramifications of adopting such pervasive technology on a society-wide scale have not been adequately considered. Smart things endowed with artificial intelligence may carry out decisions that entail ethical consequences. It is assumed that the functioning of a smart device does not involve any ethical responsibility vis-a-vis its application context. Such a perspective may precipitate situations that endanger essential human values or cause physical or emotional harm. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the design of ethics within intelligent systems to safeguard human interests. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel method based on Boolean algebra that enables a machine to exhibit varying ethical behaviour by employing the concept of ethics categories and ethics modes. Such enhancement of smart things offers a way to design ethically compliant smart devices and paves way for human friendly technology ecosystems.},

In this paper, we bring a thorough study on the energy consumption, time consumption and cost of using resource of cloudlet and cloud for workflow applications in mobile edge computing. Based on theoretical analysis, a multi-objective optimization model is established.

  abstract={Edge computing brings computing and storage resources closer to (mobile) end users and data sources, thus bypassing expensive and slow links to distant cloud computing infrastructures. Often leveraged opportunistically, these heterogeneous resources can be used to offload data and computations, enabling upcoming demanding applications such as augmented reality and autonomous driving. Research in this direction has addressed various challenges, from architectural concerns to runtime optimizations. As of today, however, we lack a widespread availability of edge computing-partly because it remains unclear which of the promised benefits of edge computing are relevant for what types of applications. This article provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current edge computing landscape, with a focus on the application perspective. We outline the characteristics of edge computing and its postulated benefits and drawbacks. To understand the functional composition of applications, we first define common application components that are relevant w.r.t. edge computing. We then present a classification of proposed use cases and analyze them according to their expected benefits from edge computing and which components they use. Furthermore, we illustrate existing products and industry solutions that have recently surfaced and outline future research challenges.},

  abstract={As mobile devices evolve to be powerful and pervasive computing tools, their usage also continues to increase rapidly. However, mobile device users frequently experience problems when running intensive applications on the device itself, or offloading to remote clouds, due to resource shortage and connectivity issues. Ironically, most users' environments are saturated with devices with significant computational resources. This paper argues that nearby mobile devices can efficiently be utilised as a crowd-powered resource cloud to complement the remote clouds. Node heterogeneity, unknown worker capability, and dynamism are identified as essential challenges to be addressed when scheduling work among nearby mobile devices. We present a work-sharing model, called Honeybee, using an adaptation of the well-known work stealing method to load balance independent jobs among heterogeneous mobile nodes, able to accommodate nodes randomly leaving and joining the system. The overall strategy of Honeybee is to focus on short-term goals, taking advantage of opportunities as they arise, based on the concepts of proactive workers and opportunistic delegator. We evaluate our model using a prototype framework built using Android and implement two applications. We report speedups of up to four with seven devices and energy savings up to 71 percent with height devices.},

Without first settling the quest for what thing is or could be or do, we run the risk of presumptuous visions, or hypes, that can only fail the realities and limits of what is actually possible, leading to customers and consumers confusion as well as market hesitations. Specifically, without a carefully-designed Thing architecture in place, it will be very difficult to find the "magic" we are so addicted and accustomed to - programming! Programming the IoT, as we once programmed the mainframe, the workstation, the PC and the mobile devices, is the natural way to realize a fancy IoT scenario or an application. Without Thing architectures and their enablement of new programming models for IoT - we will continue to only envision fancy scenarios but unable to unleash the IoT full potential. This article raises these concerns and provides a view into the future by first looking back into our short history of pervasive computing. The article focuses on the domain of "Personal" IoT and will address key new requirements for such Thing architecture. Also, practicing what we preach, we present our ongoing efforts on the Atlas Thing Architecture showing how it supports a variety of thing notions, and how it enables novel models for programmability.},

In normal time, the EasyFind system can provide the fastest guiding path with the shortest moving time to a destination place based on the density of indoor people in each area. In addition, in emergency time, the EasyFind system can evacuate all people in the shortest total escaping time through modeling spatial and temporal mobilities of indoor people. Furthermore, the EasyFind system can cooperatively find lost items equipped with mobile iBeacon nodes through participatory sensing networks formed by mobile users with smartphones in places with static iBeacon nodes. To precisely localize the lost item, six item localization cases are addressed to reduce the positioning errors with different numbers of smartphones detecting the lost item and different numbers of fixed iBeacon nodes nearby these item-detecting smartphones.

  abstract={Due to their limited functionality, ubiquitous connected devices in the Internet of Things rely heavily on the computational and storage resources of the cloud. However, mainstream cloud systems always require high network bandwidth and cannot satisfy the delay requirement of real-time applications. Therefore, a new paradigm called multiaccess edge computing has emerged to offload the computation and storage needs of end user devices to the edge cloud servers located in the radio access networks of 5G mobile networks. In this paper, we study and compare three load sharing schemes, namely, no sharing, random sharing, and least loaded sharing, which exploit the collaboration between clustered servers in different degrees. We develop computationally efficient analytical models to evaluate the performance of these schemes. These models are validated by simulation, and then used to compare the performances of the three load sharing schemes under various system parameters. Comparison results show that the least loaded sharing scheme is most suitable to fully exploit the collaboration between the servers and achieve load balance among them. It contributes to reducing the blocking probability and waiting time experienced by users.},

  abstract={The ability to send messages to mobile subscribers has become immensely popular since the introduction of Short message Service (SMS). Despite of different messaging solutions today, SMS is still used for many services. The 5G core network and mobile terminals will support SMS transfer over non-access stratum messages. As a key technology for 5G Multi-access edge computing that distributes cloud intelligence at the network edge may be used to deliver context aware text messaging to mobile subscribers without the support of core network functionality. In this paper, we propose a new mobile edge service that enables third party applications to send messages to mobile subscribers. Third party text messaging at the network edge decreases the core network signaling and saves network resources while at the same time delivers timely location and context based information. The service is described by typical use cases, interfaces definition and the respective data model. Some implementation aspects are discussed related to the service state models supported by a mobile edge application and the platform.},

  abstract={Future pervasive applications, like mobile augmented reality, have huge bandwidth and computation demands and very stringent delay constraints. Edge computing has been proposed to cope with such challenging requirements, since it shortens significantly the distance between the end users and the servers. On the other hand, serverless computing is emerging among cloud technologies to respond to the need of highly scalable event-driven execution of stateless tasks. In this paper, we investigate the convergence of the two to enable very low-latency execution of short-lived stateless tasks whose computation is offloaded from the user terminal to servers hosted by or close to edge devices in mobile pervasive environments. We realized a proof-of-concept implementation to delve into the specific issue of efficient dispatching of tasks in a distributed manner to achieve high scalability. We evaluated our proposed algorithm with experiments in a large-scale emulated network environment, showing that our solution achieves similar or better delay performance than a centralized solution, with far less network utilization.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a new paradigm for the development of heterogeneous and distributed systems, and it has increasingly become a ubiquitous computing service platform. However, due to the lack of sufficient computing and storage resources dedicated to the processing and storage of huge volumes of the IoT data, it tends to adopt a cloud-based architecture to address the issues of resource constraints. Hence, a series of challenging security and trust concerns have arisen in the cloud-based IoT context. To this end, a novel trust assessment framework for the security and reputation of cloud services is proposed. This framework enables the trust evaluation of cloud services in order to ensure the security of the cloud-based IoT context via integrating security- and reputation-based trust assessment methods. The security-based trust assessment method employs the cloud-specific security metrics to evaluate the security of a cloud service. Furthermore, the feedback ratings on the quality of cloud service are exploited in the reputation-based trust assessment method in order to evaluate the reputation of a cloud service. The experiments conducted using a synthesized dataset of security metrics and a real-world web service dataset show that our proposed trust assessment framework can efficiently and effectively assess the trustworthiness of a cloud service while outperforming other trust assessment methods.},

The initial step of an IoT workflow is node identification so that the devices can get access to the network. The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system is being considered as an enabling technology for the node discovery due to its features like low cost, non-line of sight scanning and high scan speed. The nodes should be authenticated at the time of identification in order to avoid entry of malicious users into the network through the perception layer. Numerous authentication protocols have been presented for RFID system since last decade. The cryptanalysis of these protocols highlighted their architectural and structural weaknesses. This paper presents a full disclosure attack on the RFID based node authentication system presented by Tewari and Gupta. The proposed attack is passive in nature with success probability of 1/L2.},

Self organizing networks within the IoT field give rise to engagement of various nodes for data communication. The rise in Cyber-attacks within IoT pose a lot of threat to these connected nodes and hence there is a need for data passing through nodes to be verified during communication. In this paper we proposed a nodal authentication approach in IoT using blockchain in securing the integrity of data passing through the nodes in IoT. In our work, we engaged the GOST algorithm in our approach. At the end, we achieved a nodal authentication and verification of the transmitted data. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to fake a node in the communication chain of the connected nodes. Data integrity was achieved in the nodes during the communication.},

  abstract={The ubiquitous connections of physical objects in Internet of Things (IoT) is undoubtedly challenging the consistency mapping between physical space and cyberspace. As the key techniques for establishing the correspondences between physical objects and cyber entities, the objects identification and resolution (IR) attracted extensive attention. Conventional IR schemes in IoT generally rely on a single-mode of identification (ID) or nonidentification (nID) IR, which has big limitations in adaptability and reliability. In this case, a combined IR scheme based on ID and nID is proposed in this paper. In our proposed scheme, the ID code and nID features complement each other so as to break the restrictions of application domain and to provide better and humanized services. In order to improve the efficiency of the scheme, edge computing is introduced to reduce network transmission load and the computing burden of cloud, especially when the input data requires large amount of computing and storage resources. Furthermore, we design and implement a prototype of electronic product code (EPC) (ID) and fingerprint (nID) combined IR. Simulation results show that the edge computing-based ID and nID combined IR scheme has advantages in resolution accuracy and efficiency.},

The pervasive nature of the Internet allows the deployment of a large number of these devices across multiple technological domains. However, due to a large number of such devices involved in massive deployment, manual setup, management and maintenance are infeasible. In order to overcome issues arising from manual management, intelligent and automatic procedures need to be established to manage connected devices at a large scale. Autonomic computing is one such technique that can minimize user intervention in the management of the IoT ecosystem. Autonomic computing has been proven effective for minimizing user intervention in the management of computer systems.

We specifically discuss various enabling technologies that can help in attaining autonomy in IoT. In addition, we highlight the current challenges and some possible directions for future research.},

Deep learning is a hot research field as it can automatically extract significant features from raw data. In this paper, we propose an approach: an ELM-based deep model, which combined convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer ELM (ML-ELM) as feature extractor, and used kernel ELM (KELM) as classifier.

  abstract={Smart toys have captured an increasing share of the toy market, and are growing ubiquitous in households with children. Smart toys are a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, containing sensors, actuators, and/or artificial intelligence capabilities. They frequently have Internet connectivity, directly or indirectly through companion apps, and collect information about their users and environments. Recent studies have found security flaws in many smart toys that have led to serious privacy leaks, or allowed tracking a child's physical location. Some well-publicized discoveries of this nature have prompted actions from governments around the world to ban some of these toys. Compared to other IoT devices, smart toys pose unique risks because of their easily vulnerable user base, and this paper is intended to define these risks and assess a subset of toys against them. We provide a classification of threats specific to smart toys in order to unite and complement existing adhoc analyses, and help comprehensive evaluation of other smart toys. Our vulnerability taxonomy addresses the potential security and privacy flaws that can lead to leakage of private information or allow an adversary to control the toy to lure, harm, or distress a child. Using this taxonomy, we perform a thorough experimental analysis of eleven smart toys and their companion apps. Our systematic analysis has uncovered that several current toys still expose children to multiple threats for attackers with physical, nearby, or remote access to the toy.},

  abstract={Opportunistic networking is one way to realize pervasive applications while placing little demand on network infrastructure, especially for operating in less well connected environments. In contrast to the ubiquitous network access model inherent to many cloud-based applications, for which the web browser forms the user front end, opportunistic applications require installing software on mobile devices. Even though app stores (when accessible)offer scalable distribution mechanisms for applications, a designer needs to support multiple OS platforms and only some of those are suitable for opportunistic operation to begin with. In this paper, we present a web-based framework that allows users to interact with opportunistic application content without installing the respective app and thus also includes users whose mobile OSes do not support opportunistic networking at all via minimal stand-alone infrastructure. We describe our system and protocol design, validate its operation using simulations and a testbed. We implement web versions of two existing native mobile opportunistic applications: PeopleFinder and Here & Now.},

  abstract={The fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication system aims to deliver a ubiquitous mobile service with enhanced quality of service (QoS). It is also expected to enable new use-cases for various vertical industrial applications-such as automobiles, public transportation, medical care, energy, public safety, agriculture, entertainment, manufacturing, and so on. Rapid increases are predicted to occur in user density, traffic volume, and data rate. This calls for novel solutions to the requirements of both mobile users and vertical industries in the next decade. Among various available options, one that appears attractive is to redesign the network architecture-more specifically, to reconstruct the radio access network (RAN). In this paper, we present an inclusive and comprehensive survey on various RAN architectures toward 5G, namely cloud-RAN, heterogeneous cloud-RAN, virtualized cloud-RAN, and fog-RAN. We compare them from various perspectives, such as energy consumption, operations expenditure, resource allocation, spectrum efficiency, system architecture, and network performance. Moreover, we review the key enabling technologies for 5G systems, such as multi-access edge computing, network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and network slicing; and some crucial radio access technologies (RATs), such as millimeter wave, massive multi-input multi-output, device-to-device communication, and massive machine-type communication. Last but not least, we discuss the major research challenges in 5G RAN and 5G RATs and identify several possible directions of future research.},

  abstract={Automatic service composition in mobile and pervasive computing faces many challenges due to the complex nature of the environment. Common approaches address service composition from optimization perspectives which are not feasible in practice due to the intractability of the problem, limited computational resources of smart devices, service host's mobility, and time constraints. Our main contribution is the development of a cognitively-inspired agent-based service composition model focused on bounded rationality rather than optimality, which allows the system to compensate for limited resources by selectively filtering out continuous streams of data. The evaluation of our approach shows promising results when compared against state-of-the-art service composition models.},

  abstract={LTE 230MHz wireless private network designed to provide services of long-range data transfer for power system, plays an important role especially in ubiquitous power Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, there has been a highlight in interest in LTE (Long Term Evolution) technologies based on their advantages to meet the requirements of high speed, low communication latency and better coverage. Nevertheless, how to make full of these advantages for power applications has considerable challenges, such as the reliable operation of power system, the adequacy and security issues and cost-performance-reliability trade-off. This paper first synthesizes the evolution of LTE 230MHz, and describes current approaches, benefits, and barriers to its application for pratical life, while identifying their merits and weaknesses. It then discusses two of typical case studies applied in ubiquitous power IoT with regard to its issues, and if the community of ubiquitous power IoT is to be successful in doing so, alerts researchers to opportunities for conducting advanced research in reducing the rising tide of time consumption and cost, particularly in edge devices that are the target of ubiquitous power IoT which will determine the level of energy internet. We propose a solution to implementation of ubiquitous power IoT through the typical application scenarios, and discuss how to construct an edge-cloud collaboration architecture that can gain lower latency, less energy consumption, better reliability and maximum efficiency in operations. Through the architecture can make an accurate and convenient prediction and analysis combined with the architecture when applied to the area of ubiquitous power IoT for energy internet.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been found pervasive use cases and become a driving force to constitute a digital society. The ultimate goal of IoT is data and the intelligence generated from data. With the progress in public cloud computing technologies, more and more data can be stored, processed and analyzed in cloud to release the power of IoT. However, due to the heterogeneity of hardware and communication protocols in the IoT world, the interoperability and compatibility among different link layer protocols, sub-systems, and back-end services have become a significant challenge to IoT practices. This challenge cannot be addressed by public cloud suppliers since their efforts are mainly put into software and platform services but can hardly be extended to end devices. In this paper, we propose a data-centric IoT framework that incorporates three promising protocols with fundamental security schemes, i.e., WiFi, Thread, and LoRaWAN, to cater to massive IoT and broadband IoT use cases in local, personal, and wide area networks. By taking advantages of the Azure cloud infrastructure, the framework features a unified device management model and data model to conquer the interoperability challenge. We also provide implementation and a case study to validate the framework for practical applications.},

It is highly hoped that advanced ICT will be used to manage health and that elderly people, regardless of their age, can actively participate in society even if they live alone. Conventional centralized health management systems are costly, associative of high communication delays, prone to high-security risks, and difficult to share the data.

These resources make it possible for edge devices to conduct data transactions (e.g., micro-payments, micro-access control). The blockchain technology can be used to ensure transaction unmodifiable and undeniable. In this paper, we propose a blockchain system that adapts to the limitations of edge devices. The new blockchain system can fairly and efficiently allocate storage resources on edge devices, which makes it scalable. We find the optimal peer nodes for transaction data storage in the blockchain, and propose a recent block storage allocation scheme for quick retrieval of missing blocks. The proposed blockchain system can also reach mining consensus with low energy consumption in edge devices with a new Proof of Stake mechanism. Extensive simulations show that our proposed blockchain system works efficiently in edge environments. On average, the new system uses 15% less time and consumes 64% less battery power when compared with traditional blockchain systems.},

  abstract={When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.},

  abstract={As a novel computing technology closer to business ends, edge computing has become an effective solution for delay sensitive business of power Internet of Things (IoT) and promotes the application and development of the IoT technology in smart grids. However, the inherent characteristics of a single edge node with limited resources may fail to meet the delay requirements for access ubiquitous IoT businesses of massive access. Multiple edge nodes are needed to cooperate with each other to optimize workload allocation to provide lower delay services. To this end, this paper proposes a workload allocation mechanism, orienting edge computing-based power IoT, which minimizes service delay. The workload optimization allocation model is established, and the optimal workload allocation oriented on delay among multiple edge nodes is further realized on the basis of computing resource optimization within the single edge node. The balanced initialization, resource allocation, and task allocation (BRT) algorithm are proposed. Based on the balanced initialization of workload within edge nodes, the particle swarm algorithm modified by the pheromone strategy is used to solve the problem of the computing resources' allocation inside edge nodes. Finally, the task allocation among multiple edge servers is converted into a semi-definite programming problem. The simulation results show that the proposed BRT algorithm reduces the service delay by 9.1%, 16.9%, and 26.4%, and the service delay growth rate by 24.6%, 34.5%, and 38.7%, respectively, compared with the simulated annealing algorithm (SAA), LoAd Balancing (LAB), and Latency-awarE workloAd offloaDing (LEAD) algorithms.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous computing is playing a vital role in the provision of healthcare services through advanced technologies. The ubiquitous environment where resources can be accessed by anyone at anytime regardless of location have brought revolution in delivery and accessibility of healthcare services even in remote areas. Therefore, in recent years more research contributions can be seen to propose digitalized healthcare services in the form of mobile and e-Services that are accessible through ubiquitous devices. To exploit the underlining potential of ubiquitous computing, in this research we have proposed a ubiquitous healthcare framework for provision of healthcare services in remote rural areas in province of Punjab, Pakistan. The research has employed a case study research approach to understand the phenomena in depth and in its real context. The unit of analysis is provision of antenatal and child healthcare services at basic health units in the selected region. The case study is constructed through field study by engaging healthcare professionals working at basic health units and data is collected through focus group interviews with healthcare professionals. A proof-of-the-concept ubiquitous framework is proposed as part of the case study by constructing various services to facilitate healthcare professionals in rural areas. To evaluate the proposed ubiquitous framework, an evaluation framework based on usability, information system and ISO models is constructed. Hypothesis are constructed to measure user satisfaction through twelve constructs of the evaluation framework that include availability, adaptability, memorability, effectiveness, responsiveness, cognitive load, error recovery, ease to understand, ease of learning, efficiency of use, navigation, and execution. The data is collected through field surveys by conducting walkthroughs with healthcare professionals in rural areas. The analysis of the data is carried out by employing structured equation modeling in SPSS. The results provide highly significant relationship between constructs and user satisfaction. The study findings show that the healthcare problem in rural areas could be addressed through ubiquitous solutions however, while designing, constructing and evaluating these solutions, the involvement of relevant community is crucial.},

  abstract={In the envisioned ubiquitous world, services will follow users as they move across smart surroundings. Services are instantiated to users through the environment, appearing and disappearing as they move, which reduces the need for personal communication devices such as smartphones or tablets. To facilitate this development, service architectures need to support virtualized, on-demand service composition based on the hardware and software resources available at the current user location. The technical context for this type of user interaction with digital services through smart surroundings is called Internet of Everything (IoE). Today's service architectures will be too inflexible in this highly decentralized and dynamic environment. Hence, in this article we propose a novel service model called nanoEdge, where nodes collaboratively provide needed functions for virtual services that need to be deployed locally due to performance, efficiency or reliability requirements, for example. The main contributions of this article are the nanoEdge conceptual model and its proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation to show that the model is feasible with regard to performance and resource-efficiency. The successful demonstration of PoC implementation exemplifies future IoE service scenarios with today's hardware components.},

A recent NATO IST 147 RTG demonstration proved the validity of SPF, but also highlighted the need of extending the current architecture to support specific use-case scenarios for HADR systems. This paper tries to propose a generic architecture based on SPF to enable interoperability between military C2 (Command and Control) and core computing systems to support future HADR operations in Smart City environments.},

Unfortunately, cyber-security paradigms have not evolved at the same pace and are not yet able to effectively tackle the progressive disappearing of a sharp security perimeter. In this paper, we describe a novel cyber-security architecture for cloud-based distributed applications and network services. We propose a security orchestrator that controls pervasive, lightweight, and programmable security hooks embedded in the virtual functions that compose the cloud application, pursuing better visibility and more automation in this domain. Our approach improves existing management practice for service orchestration, by decoupling the management of the business logic from that of security. We also describe the current implementation stage for a programmable monitoring, inspection, and enforcement framework, which represents the ground technology for the realization of the whole architecture.},

  abstract={The relentless development of the Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies and the gradual maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a powerful cognitive computing ability. Users can now access efficient and convenient smart services in smart-city, green-IoT, and heterogeneous networks. AI has been applied in various areas, including the intelligent household, advanced health-care, automatic driving, and emotional interactions. This paper focuses on current wireless-communication technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT). We put forward a cognitive LPWA-network (Cognitive-LPWAN) architecture to safeguard stable and efficient communications in a heterogeneous IoT. To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method. The experimental results show that our scheme can meet the demands of communication-delay applications. Cognitive-LPWAN selects appropriate communication technologies to achieve a better interaction experience.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), forming the foundation of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), connects a huge number of ubiquitous sensing and mobile computing devices. The mobile IoT systems generate an enormous volume of a variety of dynamic context data and typically count on centralized architectures to process them. However, their inability to ensure security and decline in communication efficiency and response time with the increase in the size of IoT network are some of the many concerning weaknesses that are holding back the fast-paced growth of IoT. Realizing the limitations of centralized systems, recently blockchain-based decentralized architecture is being considered as the key to redesigning the IoT systems in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. However, before realizing the new promise of blockchain for IoT, there are significant challenges to address. One fundamental challenge is the scale issue around data collection, storage, and analytic as IoT sensor devices possess limited computational power and storage capabilities. In particular, since the chain is always growing, IoT devices require more and more resources. Thus, an oversized chain poses storage and scalability problems. With this in mind, the overall goal of our research is to design a lightweight scalable blockchain framework for IoT of mobile devices. This framework, coined as "Sensor-Chain", promises a new generation of lightweight blockchain management with a superior reduction in resource consumption, and at the same time capable of retaining critical information about the IoT systems of mobile devices.},

  abstract={Fog computing extends the facility of cloud computing from the center to edge networks. Although fog computing has the advantages of location awareness and low latency, the rising requirements of ubiquitous connectivity and ultra-low latency challenge real-time traffic management for smart cities. As an integration of fog computing and vehicular networks, vehicular fog computing (VFC) is promising to achieve real-time and location-aware network responses. Since the concept and use case of VFC are in the initial phase, this article first constructs a three-layer VFC model to enable distributed traffic management in order to minimize the response time of citywide events collected and reported by vehicles. Furthermore, the VFC-enabled offloading scheme is formulated as an optimization problem by leveraging moving and parked vehicles as fog nodes. A real-world taxi-trajectory-based performance analysis validates our model. Finally, some research challenges and open issues toward VFC-enabled traffic management are summarized and highlighted.},

  abstract={In the context of a fast aging population and of its increasing need for healthcare and assistance, ubiquitous usage of Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart applications can mitigate the consequential social burden. Connected sensors and devices inside the seniors' home produce a significant amount of data about them and their daily activities. IoT and Big Data Analytics (BDA) are an important mean to derive knowledge and support for improving the life conditions for the older adults by increasing the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for accomplish this goal. IoT analytics can aid in personalizing applications that benefit both elderly people and the ever-growing industries that need adapt their offer to the consumer's profiles. This paper presents a new platform that enables innovative analytics on IoT captured data from smart residences of elderly people. A solution based on the use of fog nodes and cloud system is suggested in order to afford data-driven services and to manage the complexity and provision of the necessary resources for online and offline data processing, storage, and analysis. The requirements and the design of the platform architecture are underlined. We propose an architecture of a platform based on fog computing nodes coupled with cloud computing that offers an efficient near real time processing of the big data resulted from IoT system that provides insights and data processing and analysis facilities into cloud.

  abstract={Increased automation and intelligence in computer systems have revealed limitations of Cloud-based computing such as unpredicted latency in safety-critical and performance-sensitive applications. The amount of data generated from ubiquitous sensors has reached a degree where it becomes impractical to always store and process in the Cloud. Edge computing brings computation and storage to the Edge of the network near to where the data originates yielding reduced network load and better performance of services. In parallel, new wireless communication technologies have appeared to facilitate the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT). Instead of seeking higher data rates, low-power wide-area network aims at battery-powered sensor nodes and devices which require reliable communication for a prolonged period of time. Recently, Long Range (LoRa) has become a popular choice for IoT-based solutions. In this paper, we explore and analyze different application fields and related works which use LoRa and investigate potential improvement opportunities and considerations. Furthermore, we propose a generic architecture to integrate Edge computation capability in IoT-based applications for enhanced performance.},

Afterwards, we have developed activity recognition system using LoRaWAN sensors. We have studied data loss performance analysis in a caregiving center in Japan by deploying 42 LoRaWAN sensors. We also have developed a large dataset of elderly peoples' daily activities from various sensors, with ground truth data that are collected from the nurses.

In this paper, we investigate the improvement of application latency by introducing edge computing environments and the resulting service quality through some experiments. A network-oriented mixed-reality (MR) application that operates a remote robot through users' gestures and displays location-aware information through edge server is implemented as a simplified implementation of cyber-physical networking applications. The results of our experiments reveal that service quality suddenly gets worse when application latency becomes around 1 [sec]. In other words, the service quality of the network-oriented MR application is expected to be improved by introducing edge computing when latency of application running on cloud computing environments is about 1 [sec].},

  abstract={A rapidly growing number of various sensors, objects and smart devices that are capable of communicating with each other without human intervention are leading the emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and its applications. As a major building block of IoT, Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) that consists of a set of resource-constrained nodes in terms of communication, computation, memory, and energy plays an essential role in the realization of ubiquitous computing and communication paradigm. In order to provide both efficient and reliable communication and enable the integration of resource-constrained nodes into the Internet, a novel routing protocol for LLNs, also referred to as RPL, has been proposed. However, LLNs running with RPL are vulnerable to various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks because of inherent resource constraints, the lack of tamper resistance and security features of routing protocol. In this paper, we present and investigate a new type of DoS attack, called spam DIS attack, in swiftly burgeoning RPL-based LLNs. In spam DIS attack, the malicious node multicasts a large number of DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) messages with different fictitious identities to cause the legitimate nodes to restart the Trickle algorithm and broadcast an excessive number of DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages, which drain down the energy resource of legitimate nodes, and finally make the legitimate nodes suffer from denial of service. We conduct extensive simulation experiments for performance evaluation of spam DIS attack and comparison with original RPL without adversary. The simulation results indicate that the spam DIS attack is an extremely severe DoS attack in RPL-based LLNs.},

In this paper, we put forth a couple-like computing method using cooperative computing between a central server and edge terminal for timely detection of potential risks at construction sites. Specifically, we assemble NVIDIA Jetson TX2 on each surveillance terminal and compute video at 3 frames per second for coarse detection. If the target is identified, the video is then transmitted to the central server for precise detection. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: reducing network traffic and reducing the computational burden for the central server. Our experiment is conducted using IoTbased intelligent surveillance systems at a real construction site to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method.},

The possible attacks that can be executed on cloud have been explained along with the scenario and motive of the attacker behind that attack. To tackle the attacks, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is quite a good solution in cyber industry.

  abstract={The integration of standards and technologies and the ability to connect massive smaller devices, objects and sensors, inexpensively and easily has created a world that is hyper connected with bridging the virtual and physical things to generate, process, exchange and consume data for the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is a union of standards, technologies and connection of devices in the real world that communicate in the online realm. This type of technology is useful in data generation, processing, exchanging and decision-making. IoT is widely considered one of the larges revolutions in the Information age. IoT has several issues related to addressing, regulation, security and privacy, and standardization. Once these issues have been resolved, development and growth of complex IoT applications will take place. This paper discusses the future of intelligent devices and pervasive connectivity, data sharing and creation of partnerships, overcoming interoperability issues, security and regulations, technology and applications whilst experiencing waves of new technology advancement.},

  abstract={Intrusion detection is one essential tool towards building secure and trustworthy Cloud computing environment, given the ubiquitous presence of cyber attacks that proliferate rapidly and morph dynamically. In our current working paradigm of resource, platform and service consolidations, Cloud Computing provides a significant improvement in the cost metrics via dynamic provisioning of IT services. Since almost all cloud computing networks lean on providing their services through Internet, they are prone to experience variety of security issues. Therefore, in cloud environments, it is necessary to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect new and unknown attacks in addition to signature based known attacks, with high accuracy. In our deliberation we assume that a system or a network “anomalous” event is synonymous to an “intrusion” event when there is a significant departure in one or more underlying system or network activities. There are couple of recently proposed ideas that aim to develop a hybrid detection mechanism, combining advantages of signature-based detection schemes with the ability to detect unknown attacks based on anomalies. In this work, we propose a network based anomaly detection system at the Cloud Hypervisor level that utilizes a hybrid algorithm: a combination of K-means clustering algorithm and SVM classification algorithm, to improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system. Dataset from UNSW-NB15 study is used to evaluate the proposed approach and results are compared with previous studies. The accuracy for our proposed K-means clustering model is slightly higher than others. However, the accuracy we obtained from the SVM model is still low for supervised techniques.},

  abstract={The proliferation of ubiquitous computing requires energy-efficient as well as secure operation of modern processors. Side channel attacks are becoming a critical threat to security and privacy of devices embedded in modern computing infrastructures. Unintended information leakage via physical signatures such as power consumption, electromagnetic emission (EM) and execution time have emerged as a key security consideration for SoCs. Also, information published on purpose at user privilege level accessible through software interfaces results in software-only attacks. In this paper, we used a supervised learning based approach for inferring applications executing on android platform based on features extracted from EM side-channel emissions and software exposed dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) states. We highlight the importance of machine learning based approach in utilizing these multi-dimensional features on a complex SoC, against profiling-based approaches. We also show that learning the instantaneous frequency states polled from on-board frequency driver (cpufreq) is adequate to identify a known application and flag potentially malicious unknown application. The experimental results on benchmarking applications running on ARMv8 processor in Snapdragon 820 board demonstrates early detection of these apps in 700 ms, and atleast 85% accuracy in detecting unknown applications. Overall, the highlight is to utilize a low-complexity path to application inference attacks through learning instantaneous frequency states pattern of CPU core.},

  abstract={With the construction and promotion of the Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things (UPIoT), it is an increasingly urgent challenge to comprehensively improve the recognition accuracy of the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) partial discharge (PD), and to incorporate the model into UPIoT intelligent terminals supported by edge computing in embedded systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel MobileNets convolutional neural network (MCNN) model to identify the GIS PD patterns. We first construct the PD pattern recognition classification datasets by means of experiments and FDTD simulation, and also preprocess images via binarization processing. After constructing the MCNN model, depthwise separable convolutions and an inverse residual structure are adopted to deal with the vanishing gradient of the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in the GIS PD pattern recognition process. Then, through the graphics standardization process, the MCNN model is trained and tested. The whole training process is visualized by Tensorboard. Compared with other deep learning models and traditional machine learning methods, MCNN particularly stands out in recognition accuracy and time consumption with a 96.5% overall recognition rate and merely 7.3 seconds in training time. This research explores how to optimize the model by improving the recognition accuracy, and by reducing its computing load, storage space and energy consumption for better incorporation into intelligent terminals in the UPIoT context.},

  abstract={With the progress of ubiquitous computing, computers/machines can understand various human contexts via various sensors. A wearable device is possible to estimate calories burned, fatigue degree, even QoL (Quality of Life) by analyzing the heart rate, steps, sleep quality, etc. Simultaneously, the significant progress of deep learning brought the drastic performance improvement in not only image recognition, but also speech processing and natural language. Nowadays, it will become a reality that the humanoid robot instantaneously recognizes what is shown in the camera image and speaks the human-like sentences with human-like voice in multiple languages. Therefore, a collaboration between human and machines have already started. In a call center, AI chatbot has already worked to handle the typical Inquiries on behalf of human operators. A smartwatch and activity trackers keep monitoring owner's physical states and sometimes make an intervention for improving the owner's health. We are also developing the digital signage that persuades the passing person to change his/her behavior to a better way. However, there is still a distance between actual human-to-human interaction and machine-to-human interaction. That means that there is some context information that the machine side is not yet aware of. For example, while human beings observe a slight change of facial expression and body gestures, they change their way of talking and tone, but the machine can not take such information (emotion, agreement, etc.) into consideration when it generates a dialogue. In my keynote, I would like to widely introduce the leading-edge research on context recognition in the research area of ubiquitous computing. Then, I explain the requirements on how next - generation dialogue system should be. In the next-generation dialogue system, it is natural to change the content of conversation and the state of utterance according to the recognized context, for example, the conversation content will change according to the number of steps and stress situation during dialogue. Finally, we discuss technical issues required for integrating spoken dialogue system with ubiquitous computing.},

  abstract={This article reports on coupled smartwatch and smartphone pervasive apps enabling stress self-regulation. Stress, the physiological responses of an organism to demanding conditions, can be both beneficial and harmful. Beneficial stress, or eustress, enhances physical or mental abilities. Harmful stress, or distress, can result in reduced abilities, anxiety, or depression. The potential of pervasive computing to enable stress self-regulation, that is, the ability to benefit from eustress while avoiding or limiting distress, is explored in this article. It first reports on Stila Computed Stress, a stress estimate computed after an original model from pulse rates delivered by smartwatches. This article then describes how Stila Computed Stress is combined with users' activity reports and pervasively delivered on their smartwatches and smartphones. It further reports on a real life evaluation pointing to the pervasive apps' persuasiveness, that is, the apps' capacity to increase subjective stress awareness so as to enhance stress self-regulation.},

  abstract={As a new paradigm providing economic and low latency network, Fog computing can provide storage and computational capabilities to the electrical users. Since the Ubiquitous Smart Grid environment is complex and dynamic, it is an important problem for electrical provider to allocate the non-infinite electrical computing resources of nodes to reach an optimal and state performance. To maximum the benefits and resource utilization while satisfying users requests, it is essential for service provider to allocate resources adaptively for different conditions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource optimization allocation framework for the problem of Fog resource allocation for Ubiquitous Smart Grid. A dynamic differential game model is modeled and analyzed to solve the independent optimization. The experiments results support a theoretical foundation that can help service provider make the optimal dynamic strategies when users change their strategies.},

  abstract={Energy-saving (ES) systems developed on the basis of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) by heavily relying on automated understanding of human behaviors and activities recognition is of paramount importance in smart home. However, classic approaches are incapable to understand the relations among users' contexts and ES of appliances very well, and they cannot handle massive metering and time-varying user context datasets. Moreover, privacy concern is thoroughly aroused from both the residential and utility provider sides as to its essentiality. To tackle these problems, we propose a privacy-preserving and residential context-aware online ES (PRCOES) system in an IoT-enabled smart home environment. We model the repeated interaction of ES of appliances and the activity recognition of user context as a contextual multiarmed bandits (CMAB) problem, where the context-aware online learning algorithm can predict appropriate energy offers (EOs) that could meet the users' satisfaction, task completion rate, and ES purposes for appliances. We utilize a tree-based structure expanding from top to bottom to recommend EOs, which supports ever-increasing big metering datasets with user context-awareness. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposal achieves sublinear regret and differential privacy for both residents and utility provider. Experiments results validate that PRCOES could enhance users' experience and prolong users' engagement in everyday ES while guarantee the privacy for both residents and utility provider.},

  abstract={Life in modern society becomes easier due to the rapid growth of different technologies like real-time analytic, ubiquitous wireless communication, commodity sensors, machine learning and embedded systems. Nowadays, there seems to be a need to merge these technologies in the form of Internet of Things (IoT) so that smart systems can be achieved. On the other hand, cloud computing is a pillar in IoT by which end users get connected through the cloud servers for getting different services. However, to recognise the legitimacy of communicators during communication sessions through insecure channels like the Internet, serious issues in cloud-based IoT applications need to be addressed. Thus, authentication procedure is highly desirable to remove the unapproved access in IoT applications. This study presents an ElGamal cryptosystem and biometric information along with a user's password-based authentication scheme for cloud-based IoT applications refereed as SAS-Cloud. Security of the proposed scheme has been analysed by well popular random oracle model and it is found that SAS-Cloud has the ability to defend all the possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of SAS-Cloud has been evaluated and it was found that SAS-Cloud has better efficiency than other existing competing ElGamal cryptosystem-based authentication schemes.},

  abstract={In this paper, we focus on Kendo, which is a traditional sport in Japan, and propose a strikes-thrusts activity recognition method using a wrist sensor towards a pervasive Kendo support system. We collected the inertial sensor data set from 6 subjects. We attached 3 inertial sensor units (IMUs) on the subjects body, and 2 IMUs on the Shinai (bamboo sword used for Kendo). On the body, IMUs were placed on the Right Wrist, Waist and Right Ankle. On the Shinai, they were placed on the Tsuba and Saki-Gawa. We first classified strikes-thrusts activities consisting of 4 general types, Men, Tsuki, Do, and Kote, followed by further classification into 8 detailed types. We achieved 90.0% of F-measure in the case of 4-type classification and 82.6% of F-measure in the case of 8-type classification when learning and testing the same subjects data for only Right Wrist. Further, when adding data of sensors attached to the Waist and Right Ankle, we achieved 97.5% of F-measure for 4-type classification and 91.4% of F-measure for 8-type classification. As a result of leave-one-person-out cross-validation from 6 subjects to confirm generalized performance, in the case of 4-type classification, we achieved 77.5% of F-measure by using only 2 IMUs (Right Wrist and Shinai Tsuba).},

Instead of using body sensor network-based recognition systems which are intrusive and increase equipment cost, we focus on the development of efficient HAR approach based on a single triaxial accelerometer. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the system, a novel recognition approach based on kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-based kernel extreme learning machine (QPSO-KELM) is proposed. KDA is utilized to extract more meaningful features and enhance the discrimination between different activities. To verify the effectiveness of KDA, three kinds of features including original features, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) features and KDA features are extracted and compared for activity recognition. In addition, QPSO-KELM is compared with two existing classification methods: support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM), which are commonly utilized in activity recognition. Meanwhile, two comparative optimization methods for KELM are also discussed in the experiment. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={Transportation and locomotion mode recognition from multimodal smartphone sensors is useful for providing just-in-time context-aware assistance. However, the field is currently held back by the lack of standardized datasets, recognition tasks, and evaluation criteria. Currently, the recognition methods are often tested on the ad hoc datasets acquired for one-off recognition problems and with different choices of sensors. This prevents a systematic comparative evaluation of methods within and across research groups. Our goal is to address these issues by: 1) introducing a publicly available, large-scale dataset for transportation and locomotion mode recognition from multimodal smartphone sensors; 2) suggesting 12 reference recognition scenarios, which are a superset of the tasks we identified in the related work; 3) suggesting relevant combinations of sensors to use based on energy considerations among accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and global positioning system sensors; and 4) defining precise evaluation criteria, including training and testing sets, evaluation measures, and user-independent and sensor-placement independent evaluations. Based on this, we report a systematic study of the relevance of statistical and frequency features based on the information theoretical criteria to inform recognition systems. We then systematically report the reference performance obtained on all the identified recognition scenarios using a machine-learning recognition pipeline. The extent of this analysis and the clear definition of the recognition tasks enable future researchers to evaluate their own methods in a comparable manner, thus contributing to further advances in the field. The dataset and the code are available online. http://www.shl-dataset.org/.},

  abstract={The ubiquitous luminaries provide a new dimension for indoor navigation, as they are often well-structured and the visible light is reliable for its multipath-free nature. However, existing visible light-based technologies, which are generally frequency-based, require the modulation on light sources, modification to the device, or mounting extra devices. The combination of the cost-extensive floor map and the localization system with constraints on customized hardwares for capturing the flashing frequencies, no doubt, hinders the deployment of indoor navigation systems at scale in, nowadays, smart cities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective of indoor navigation on top of the virtual graph representation. The main idea of our proposed navigation system, named PILOT, stems from exploiting the peak intensities of ubiquitous unmodulated luminaries. In PILOT, the pedestrian paths with enriched sensory data are organically integrated to derive a meaningful graph, where each vertex corresponds to a light source and pairwise adjacent vertices (or light sources) form an edge with a computed length and direction. The graph, then, serves as a global reference frame for indoor navigation while avoiding the usage of pre-deployed floor maps, localization systems, or additional hardwares. We have implemented a prototype of PILOT on the Android platform, and extensive experiments in typical indoor environments demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract={Ever increasing demand for cloud adoption is prompting researchers and engineers around the world to make cloud computing more efficient and beneficial for cloud service providers and users. Cloud computing brings profits for all when the cloud infrastructure is used efficiently, and its services are made affordable to businesses of all scales. Managing cloud data center incurs a significant cost, which includes investing in IT infrastructure at the beginning and data center management costs for power, repair, space, and so on at later stages. The power costs are contributing to a significant share in overall data center management costs, and saving in power consumption can help reduce management costs for data center owners. This paper proposes an efficient context-aware adaptive heuristic-based solution for the virtual machine (VM) placement optimization in the heterogeneous cloud data centers. The proposed VM placement technique takes into the account of physical machine characteristics and load (peak and non-peak) conditions in the heterogeneous data centers to save power and also improve performance efficiency for data center owners. The experiments conducted with real cloud workloads and also synthetic workloads against a well-known adaptive heuristic-based technique indicate significant performance improvements and energy saving with our proposed solution.},

  abstract={Human activity recognition (HAR) from sensor readings has proved to be an effective approach in pervasive computing for smart healthcare. Recent approaches in ambient assisted living (AAL) within the home or community setting offers people the prospect of independent care and improved quality of living. However, most of the available AAL systems are limited by several factors including the system complexity and computational cost. In this paper, a simple, the novel ambient HAR framework using the multivariate Gaussian is proposed. The classification framework augments prior information from passive RFID tags to obtain more detailed activity profiling. The proposed algorithm based on the multivariate Gaussian via maximum likelihood estimation is used to learn the features of the human activity model. The twelve sequential and concurrent experimental evaluations are conducted in a mock apartment environment. The sampled activities are predicted using a new dataset of the same activity and high prediction accuracy established. The proposed framework suits well for the single and multi-dwelling environment and offers pervasive sensing environment for elderly, disabled, and carers.},

  abstract={Fog/'Edge computing is increasingly used to support a wide range of latency-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its elastic computing capabilities that are offered closer to the users. Despite this promise, IoT applications with user mobility face many challenges since offloading the application functionality from the edge to the fog may not always be feasible due to the intermittent connectivity to the fog, and could require application migration among fog nodes due to user mobility. Likewise, executing the applications exclusively on the edge may not be feasible due to resource constraints and battery drain. To address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, a resource management middleware that makes effective tradeoffs between using fog and edge resources while ensuring that the latency requirements of the IoT applications are met. We evaluate URMILA in the context of a real-world use case on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.},

  abstract={To increase the quality of life and independence of people with disabilities and enderly (PDE), there must be solutions that provide accessibility in urban environments. AccompCare is a model for tracking and assisting PDE in their displacement, using mobile and ubiquitous computing to provide accessibility services. Accompcare's main contribution is the strategy of disponibilization of help. This strategy initially seeks collaborators who are close to the PDE and, not finding them, directs the request to a remote call center. The call center can guide the user through the resources of the mobile device. In addition, AccompCare contemplates an urban scenario, allowing the delimitation of several service areas. The model was implemented and evaluated by five wheelchair users through scenarios. The results showed a good acceptance by the users, considering their perceptions of usability and utility of the system.},

  abstract={In this paper, a new layered architecture is proposed for big data-driven processing and management of future smart homes. The proposed Representational State Transfer (REST)-based architecture includes seven layers: physical, fog-computing, network, cloud-computing, service, session, and application for efficient data exchange and processing tasks of future smart homes. The smart home physical layer includes all the sensing technologies and smart devices within the smart home, which monitors the home environment and its residents. The data of these sensors will be sent to the smart home fog-computing layer that can do limited data storage and processing. Then, all the required data will be sent to the cloud-computing layer using smart home network layer. The cloud-computing layer provides the scalable solution for data processing and storage. The processed data in the cloud-computing layer will be provided as the data-driven services to different smart home and third-party (e.g., smart city) applications via smart home service layer. Based on the proposed architecture, the applications will utilize the session layer and RESTFUL APIs to use the data-driven services of the smart home. The proposed smart home architecture can provide a ubiquitous and shared data environment as the key aspect of Internet-of-Things systems.},

  abstract={As a concept to enhance and extend cloud-computing capabilities, edge computing aims to provide Internet-based services in the close proximity to users by placing IT infrastructures at the network edge in forms of tiny datacenters. Taking advantage of the close distance to end user and access networks, edge datacenters can provide low-latency and context-aware services and further improve users' quality of experience. As the network edge is a geographically spread concept, the edge datacenters are usually highly distributed so that they can provide nearby storage and processing capabilities to most of the end users. Furthermore, edge datacenters also co-work with centralized cloud datacenters for service orchestration. Such decentralization and collaboration are expected to introduce significant transformations to both infrastructures and applications. To provide an overview of how edge can be integrated with cloud-computing and how edge computing can benefit applications, this paper studies the infrastructure and application issues of edge computing and networking in several sub-aspects, including related concepts, infrastructures, resource management and virtualization, performance, and applications.},

  abstract={Wearable devices have been used widely for human activity recognition in the field of pervasive computing. One big area of in this research is the recognition of activities of daily living where especially inertial and interaction sensors like RFID tags and scanners have been used. An issue that may arise when using interaction sensors is a lack of certainty. A positive signal from an interaction sensor is not necessarily caused by a performed activity e.g, when an object is only touched but no interaction occurred afterwards. In our work, we aim to overcome this limitation and present a multi-modal egocentric-based activity recognition approach which is able to recognize the critical activities by looking at movement and object information at the same time. We present our results of combining inertial and video features to recognize human activities on different types of scenarios where we achieve a F1-measure up to 79.6%.},

  abstract={A plethora of sensors embedded in wearable, mobile, and infrastructure devices allow us to seamlessly capture large parts of our daily activities and experiences. It is not hard to imagine that such data could be used to support human memory in the form of automatically generated memory cues, e.g., images, that help us remember past events. Such a vision of pervasive "memory-augmentation systems", however, comes with significant privacy and security implications, chief among them the threat of memory manipulation: without strong guarantees about the provenance of captured data, attackers would be able to manipulate our memories by deliberately injecting, removing, or modifying captured data. This work introduces this novel threat of human memory manipulation in memory augmentation systems. We then present a practical approach that addresses key memory manipulation threats by securing the captured memory streams. Finally we report evaluation results on a prototypical secure camera platform that we built.},

  abstract={Mobile health (mHealth) is considered one of the most transformative drivers for health informatics delivery of ubiquitous medical applications. Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool in classifying medical images for detecting various diseases. However, supervised machine learning requires a large amount of data to train the model, whose storage and processing pose considerable system requirements challenges for mobile applications. Therefore, many studies focus on deploying cloud-based machine learning, which takes advantage of the Internet connection to outsource data intensive computing. However, this approach comes with certain drawbacks such as those related to latency and privacy, which need to be considered in the context of sensitive data. To tackle these challenges of mHealth applications, we present an on-device inference App and use a dataset of skin cancer images to demonstrate a proof of concept. We pre-trained a Convolutional Neural Network model using 10,015 skin cancer images. The model is then deployed on a mobile device, where the inference process takes place, i.e. when presented with new test image all computations are executed locally where the test data remains. This approach reduces latency, saves bandwidth and improves privacy.},

  abstract={Advances in technology have enabled tremendous progress in the development of a highly connected ecosystem of ubiquitous computing devices collectively called the Internet of Things (IoT). Ensuring the security of IoT devices is a high priority due to the sensitive nature of the collected data. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as critical hardware primitive for ensuring the security of IoT nodes. Malicious modeling of PUF architectures has proven to be difficult due to the inherently stochastic nature of PUF architectures. Extant approaches to malicious PUF modeling assume that a priori knowledge and physical access to the PUF architecture is available for malicious attack on the IoT node. However, many IoT networks make the underlying assumption that the PUF architecture is sufficiently tamper-proof, both physically and mathematically. In this work, we show that knowledge of the underlying PUF structure is not necessary to clone a PUF. We present a novel non-invasive, architecture independent, machine learning attack for strong PUF designs with a cloning accuracy of 93.5% and improvements of up to 48.31% over an alternative, two-stage brute force attack model. We also propose a machine-learning based countermeasure, discriminator, which can distinguish cloned PUF devices and authentic PUFs with an average accuracy of 96.01%. The proposed discriminator can be used for rapidly authenticating millions of IoT nodes remotely from the cloud server.},

Our findings indicate feature reduction can reduce the number of features by close to 90%, while only having an impact of 1-2% in model performance. Moreover, we find that feature reduction can impact the generalizability of HAR models. Lastly, we find that feature reduction does not have a major impact on most classifiers examined.

As a demonstration of needed practical support for seamless context-based interaction, we present Reminisce, an application that allows users to look back on their memories by prioritizing photographs that were taken in contexts that are similar to the current context. While we focus on the use of context to draw up photographic history, the vision behind Reminisce is more general. We describe how Reminisce is built on a contextual database middleware that provides context storage and context-sensitive queries that determine the similarity between pairs of contexts. Reminisce uses the contextual database to store the contexts of a user's photos, which include location, time, neighboring devices, and weather conditions. Later, the app identifies the photos whose stored contexts are most similar to the user's current context by querying the contextual database; this query uses a context similarity function to compare entries in the database to the user's current context. During the demonstration, visitors will be able to interact with the app on the spot with auto-generated contexts and an on-device context simulation.},

  abstract={With the pervasive influence of rich sensing technologies and internet connectivity, Social Sensing based Edge Computing (SSEC) is gradually becoming the forefront of context-aware sensing applications in smart cities. These applications generate huge volumes of data which require a sustainable storage platform. While storing sensing data into the cloud can be an immense benefit, cloud-based distributed storage requires constant internet connectivity, which deems the platform unusable in emergency situations with disrupted internet connectivity. This paper introduces the idea of utilizing privately owned edge devices for a decentralized distributed data storage during emergency situations. However, persuading the edge devices to cooperate and participate in sharing storage brings about an unprecedented set of challenges. The first challenge lies in the inconsistent availability of the storage system as the edge devices may not be inclined to share storage resource. The second challenge lies in configuring all the edge devices to integrate with the storage system in a scalable manner. In this paper, we present EdgeStore, an edge-based distributed storage system that attempts to address the above challenges by introducing a game-theoretic resource incentivizing framework. We implement a prototype of EdgeStore on top of the Linux Ext4 file system using the FUSE interface.

  abstract={Privacy in the Internet of Things is a fundamental challenge for the Ubiquitous healthcare systems that depend on the data aggregated and collaborative deep learning among different parties. This paper proposes the MSCryptoNet, a novel framework that enables the scalable execution and the conversion of the state-of-the-art learned neural network to the MSCryptoNet models in the privacy-preservation setting. We also design a method for approximation of the activation function basically used in the convolutional neural network (i.e., Sigmoid and Rectified linear unit) with low degree polynomials, which is vital for computations in the homomorphic encryption schemes. Our model seems to target the following scenarios: 1) the practical way to enforce the evaluation of classifier whose inputs are encrypted with possibly different encryption schemes or even different keys while securing all operations including intermediate results and 2) the minimization of the communication and computational cost of the data providers. The MSCryptoNet is based on the multi-scheme fully homomorphic encryption. We also prove that the MSCryptoNet as a privacy-preserving deep learning scheme over the aggregated encrypted data is secured.},

  abstract={IoT gateway acts as a connection between two different networks namely the sensor network and the traditional network which is why its role and significance is of much importance. The paper will aim to configure smart gateway systems with increased flexibility of configuration which can adapt to different application requirements such as in [5], [7] and [8]. It would also provide techniques to improve the overall functioning of the system by reducing the development cycle, costs, and difficulty and also provide more ease in new applications to be applied. With exponential rise in demand of internet of things (IoT) [9] [10][12], a surge in utilization of ubiquitous connectivity to combine different types of networks, which can be an ad-hoc network along with Zigbee, cable, wireless LAN and so on131 [4] There are many standard programs where the need of a smart gateway has been realized to increase the data rate, support endto-end connectivity for applications like intelligent transportation, medical support, environmental monitoring, smart home, industry control etc. where the utilization of bandwidth of multi-hop networks is higher amongst the heterogeneous networks. This project proposes a singular easy to configure smart IoT gateway which comprises of three important advantages. Firstly, it has uniform user interface which is suitable for pliable software development. Secondly, the gateway consist of detachable architecture, where there can be customization for devices with extraordinary communication [8] methods and can also be attached in accordance with various network systems. Lastly, it provides flexibility by translating protocols to end number of sensor data accurately into a homogenous format which is better in comparison to earlier research. [1] The gateway provides enhanced flexibility, adaptability, and efficient cost cutting. The paper includes a scrupulous analysis of the data which would be acquired through multiple sensors and processes it in accordance to the requirement and its suitable application.},

  pages={279-284},
  abstract={With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), numerous IoT devices have been deployed in various living spaces such as university campuses, community centers, offices and homes. Users of IoT services are more and more willing to explore and directly interact with interested devices over mobile or web applications. However, there is a lack of online service that can efficiently schedule requests issued by various IoT users to distributed IoT devices. Efficient, cost-effective scheduling is critical to the user experience in a smart living space. In this paper, we propose iService, a cloud-based scheduling service for efficient usage of IoT resources given IoT-specific factors, such as device location, sensing capability, and energy cost. In our solution, the essential scheduling problem has been formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To efficiently address this problem in an online fashion, iService has been implemented using multiple AWS technologies. Via extensive experiments, the effectiveness of iService has been demonstrated under different request patterns and system parameters. From these experiments, we conclude that iService can improve the quality of service to the user and thus their quality of life within a pervasive living space.},

  abstract={Human activity recognition can benefit various applications including healthcare services and context awareness. Since human actions will influence WiFi signals, which can be captured by the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi, WiFi CSI based human activity recognition has gained more and more attention. Due to the complex relationship between human activities and WiFi CSI measurements, the accuracies of current recognition systems are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based approach, i.e., attention based bi-directional long short-term memory (ABLSTM), for passive human activity recognition using WiFi CSI signals. The BLSTM is employed to learn representative features in two directions from raw sequential CSI measurements. Since the learned features may have different contributions for final activity recognition, we leverage on an attention mechanism to assign different weights for all the learned features. Real experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed ABLSTM for human activity recognition. The experimental results show that our proposed ABLSTM is able to achieve the best recognition performance for all activities when compared with some benchmark approaches.},

  abstract={With the advent of safe collaborative robots, their seamless integration into human teams as teammates is starting to gain steam as part of the vision of the emerging Tactile Internet. The Tactile Internet lies at the nexus of computerization, automation, and robotization. While necessary, low task execution time and ultra-reliable human-robot connectivity are not sufficient to unleash the full potential of the resultant human-agent-robot teamwork (HART) applications. In this paper, we propose a context- and self-aware HART-centric allocation scheme for both physical and digital tasks to coordinate the automation and augmentation of mutually beneficial human-machine coactivities while spreading ownership of robots across users over integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) Tactile Internet infrastructures. In addition to realizing collective context-awareness via HART-centric task coordination, we aim at exploiting local self-awareness in order to improve the energy-delay performance of robots. Further, we present an analytical framework to estimate the packet transmission delay and human-robot connection reliability. Our results indicate that our proposed context- and self-aware HART-centric task coordination scheme obtains a low task execution time while minimizing the energy consumption and operational expenditures (OPEX) of mobile robots.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},

  pages={75189-75202},
  abstract={Human effects are complex phenomena, which are studied for pervasive healthcare and well-being. The legacy pen and paper-based affective state determination methods are limited in their scientific explanation of causes and effects. Therefore, due to advances in intelligence technology, researchers are trying to apply some advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to realize individuals' affective states. To recognize, realize, and predict a human's affective state, domain experts have studied facial expressions, speeches, social posts, neuroimages, and physiological signals. However, with the advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and wearable computing technology, on-body non-invasive medical sensor observations are an effective source for studying users' effects or emotions. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoMT-based emotion recognition system for affective state mining. Human psychophysiological observations are collected through electromyography (EMG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) medical sensors and analyzed through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the covert affective state. According to Russell's circumplex model of effects, the five basic emotional states, i.e., happy, relaxed, disgust, sad, and neutral, are considered for affective state mining. An experimental study is performed, and a benchmark dataset is used to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The higher classification accuracy of the primary affective states has justified the performance of the proposed method.},
