abstract={In this research, we considered a scheme for recording, browsing, and sharing personal voice memos using three-dimensional (3D) auditory space, and we proposed a voice memo system that can achieve auditory localization of multiple voice memos. In the system, the users can record the voice memos and place them on the surrounding relative directions. The direction of each memo is determined by head direction during the recording. After the recording, the users can browse numerous voice memos using head directions and can define the sharing attribute of each voice memo in the edit mode so that personal and public voice memos are appropriately shared with the permitted users. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme when the participants conduct a series flow, from recording the voice memos to browsing the recorded voice memos, especially focusing on the effects of the user's relative. directions and head motions.},

title={Indoor Navigation With Virtual Graph Representation: Exploiting Peak Intensities of Unmodulated Luminaries},
year={2019},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={187-200},
abstract={The ubiquitous luminaries provide a new dimension for indoor navigation, as they are often well-structured and the visible light is reliable for its multipath-free nature. However, existing visible light-based technologies, which are generally frequency-based, require the modulation on light sources, modification to the device, or mounting extra devices. The combination of the cost-extensive floor map and the localization system with constraints on customized hardwares for capturing the flashing frequencies, no doubt, hinders the deployment of indoor navigation systems at scale in, nowadays, smart cities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective of indoor navigation on top of the virtual graph representation. The main idea of our proposed navigation system, named PILOT, stems from exploiting the peak intensities of ubiquitous unmodulated luminaries. In PILOT, the pedestrian paths with enriched sensory data are organically integrated to derive a meaningful graph, where each vertex corresponds to a light source and pairwise adjacent vertices (or light sources) form an edge with a computed length and direction. The graph, then, serves as a global reference frame for indoor navigation while avoiding the usage of pre-deployed floor maps, localization systems, or additional hardwares. We have implemented a prototype of PILOT on the Android platform, and extensive experiments in typical indoor environments demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

abstract={Edge computing brings computing and storage resources closer to (mobile) end users and data sources, thus bypassing expensive and slow links to distant cloud computing infrastructures. Often leveraged opportunistically, these heterogeneous resources can be used to offload data and computations, enabling upcoming demanding applications such as augmented reality and autonomous driving. Research in this direction has addressed various challenges, from architectural concerns to runtime optimizations. As of today, however, we lack a widespread availability of edge computing-partly because it remains unclear which of the promised benefits of edge computing are relevant for what types of applications. This article provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current edge computing landscape, with a focus on the application perspective. We outline the characteristics of edge computing and its postulated benefits and drawbacks. To understand the functional composition of applications, we first define common application components that are relevant w.r.t. edge computing. We then present a classification of proposed use cases and analyze them according to their expected benefits from edge computing and which components they use. Furthermore, we illustrate existing products and industry solutions that have recently surfaced and outline future research challenges.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled unprecedented interactions with our physical world, with the aim to deliver a wide range of customizable services in many domains. With recent advancements in IoT technology, users are increasingly expecting these services to be intelligent and context aware. Nevertheless, there is still no framework capable of delivering personalized IoT services on a large scale. For such a framework to be conceived, it is likely that technologies from many domains have to be utilized. This paper examines the readiness of the leading state-of-the-art technologies in several key fields for realizing the goal of a truly scalable and personalized IoT experience. We discuss the important requirements and challenges for realizing this goal. Then, we identify the major approaches that can contribute to this goal and categorize them into: technologies for adaptive personalized sensing, scalable solutions for user-centric networking, and intelligence techniques that leverage context awareness and adaptability at the application and system levels. In the first category, our discussion centers around virtualization and reprogrammability at the sensing layer. In the second category, we investigate the readiness of Fog computing and information-centric networking to develop scalable personalized IoT infrastructures. These approaches were chosen for their combined ability to match dynamic user requirements with available system resources, while guaranteeing overall efficient utilization. Finally, in the third category, we examine context awareness, reasoning, and machine learning techniques as well as semantic technologies for realizing proactive and adaptive intelligent IoT systems and applications. This paper offers a focused discussion of the key topics that drive the research in the important and timely topic of scalable and personalized IoT networks.},

abstract={In this article, we call for a "Walk Before You Run" adjustment in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) research and development exercise. Without first settling the quest for what thing is or could be or do, we run the risk of presumptuous visions, or hypes, that can only fail the realities and limits of what is actually possible, leading to customers and consumers confusion as well as market hesitations. Specifically, without a carefully-designed Thing architecture in place, it will be very difficult to find the "magic" we are so addicted and accustomed to - programming! Programming the IoT, as we once programmed the mainframe, the workstation, the PC and the mobile devices, is the natural way to realize a fancy IoT scenario or an application. Without Thing architectures and their enablement of new programming models for IoT - we will continue to only envision fancy scenarios but unable to unleash the IoT full potential. This article raises these concerns and provides a view into the future by first looking back into our short history of pervasive computing. The article focuses on the domain of "Personal" IoT and will address key new requirements for such Thing architecture. Also, practicing what we preach, we present our ongoing efforts on the Atlas Thing Architecture showing how it supports a variety of thing notions, and how it enables novel models for programmability.},

pages={499-504},
abstract={Stress is a negative emotion that occurs in everyday life, such as driving. Recurrent exposure to stress can be detrimental to cardiovascular health in the long term. Nevertheless, the development of adaptive coping strategies can mitigate the influence of everyday stress on cardiovascular health. Understanding context is essential to modelling the occurrence of stress and other negative emotions during everyday life. However, driving is a highly dynamic environment, whereby the context is often described using ambiguous linguistic terms, which can be difficult to quantify. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic Mamdani Model to automatically estimate different categories of driving context. The system is comprised of two Membership Functions (MFs), which converts the inputs of speed and traffic density into linguistic variables. Our approach then uses these data to identify six states of driving - Idling, Journey Impedance, High Urban Workload, Low Urban Workload, High Non-Urban Workload and Low Non-Urban Workload. An interactive visualization has then been implemented that links this fuzzy logic model with psychophysiological data to identify the context of stress experienced on the road. The system has been validated using real-world data that has been collected from eight participants during their daily commuter journeys.},

Common approaches address service composition from optimization perspectives which are not feasible in practice due to the intractability of the problem, limited computational resources of smart devices, service host's mobility, and time constraints. Our main contribution is the development of a cognitively-inspired agent-based service composition model focused on bounded rationality rather than optimality, which allows the system to compensate for limited resources by selectively filtering out continuous streams of data. The evaluation of our approach shows promising results when compared against state-of-the-art service composition models.},

abstract={Mobile devices, along with wearable sensors, allow patients to access healthcare services from anywhere at any time. The longstanding constraints of computational capability and storage space on mobile devices can be alleviated by outsourcing computation- or data-intensive tasks to remote cloud centers. Thus, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been recognized as a promising approach to provide pervasive healthcare services to people in their daily life. As the development and adoption of MCC techniques in healthcare, new optimization strategies have been explored and studied to help mobile cloud healthcare services to be deployed in a more effective and efficient manner. In this survey, we demonstrate how MCC techniques have been extensively deployed in various healthcare applications and, specifically, describe the general architecture and design considerations one should take into account while designing an MCC for healthcare scenarios. Given a large number of factors that may affect the performance of the MCC and even result in catastrophic consequences in healthcare, this paper presents the state-of-the-art optimization methods on the MCC for meeting the diverse priorities and achieving the optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives. Finally, the security and privacy issues of the MCC in healthcare are also discussed.},

abstract={Human activity recognition (HAR) is a main research field of context-aware computing; the performance of HAR mainly depends on the feature extraction method and classification algorithm. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a single hidden layer neural network, which has better classification and generalization ability. However, ELM is not suitable for feature extraction. Deep learning is a hot research field as it can automatically extract significant features from raw data. In this paper, we propose an approach: an ELM-based deep model, which combined convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer ELM (ML-ELM) as feature extractor, and used kernel ELM (KELM) as classifier. We used CNN and ML-ELM to extract significant features, and used KELM to achieve stable performance. The performance of proposed approach is validated on two public HAR datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective.},

abstract={Monitoring the family mealtime activities enables the analysis of the previous daily routine, hence the positive changes can be made towards better relationships among family members and better physical/mental health. Moreover, the details of family mealtime activities provide important information for study in sociology and culture. This paper presents FamilyLog -- a practical system to log family mealtime activities using smartphones and smartwatches. FamilyLog automatically detects and logs details of activities during the mealtime, including occurrence and duration of meal, conversations, participants, TV viewing etc., in an unobtrusive manner. Based on the sensor data collected from real families, we carefully design robust yet lightweight signal features from a set of complex activities during the meal, including clattering sound, arm gestures of eating, human voice, TV sound, etc. Moreover, FamilyLog opportunistically fuses data from built-in sensors of multiple mobile devices available in a family with a CRFs-based classifier. To evaluate the real-world performance of FamilyLog, we perform extensive experiments that consist of 77 days of sensor data from 37 subjects in 8 families with children. FamilyLog can detect those events with high accuracy across different families and home environments.},

abstract={Existing mobile photo crowdsensing approaches focus on the participant-to-server photo pre-selection, i.e., reducing the photo redundancy from participants to a server. The server may still receive plenty of photos for a target area. Yet another important problem is to select a proper photo subset of an area from the server to a requester. This is a challenging problem because the selected subset with a small size should attain both coverage on the PoIs - Points of Interest (i.e., photo coverage of the area) and quality on the views (i.e., view quality). In this paper, we propose a novel and generic server-to-requester photo selection approach even when there are neither photo shooting direction information nor reference photos. A utility model is designed to measure photo merits of coverage and quality by exploiting photos' spatial distribution and visual representativeness. We present two photo selection schemes, basic and PoI number-aware, to maximize the photo selection utility with multiple levels of granularity. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our basic scheme outperforms the baselines by an average of 33% and 18.7% on photo coverage and view quality, respectively. Our PoI number-aware scheme can yield an additionally 44.8% improvement on the photo coverage performance.},

abstract={Wearable thermal imaging is emerging as a powerful and increasingly affordable sensing technology. Current thermal imaging solutions are mostly based on uncooled forward looking infrared (FLIR), which is susceptible to errors resulting from warming of the camera and the device casing it. To mitigate these errors, a blackbody calibration technique where a shutter whose thermal parameters are known is periodically used to calibrate the measurements. This technique, however, is only accurate when the shutter's temperature remains constant over time, which rarely is the case. In this paper, we contribute by developing a novel deep learning based calibration technique that uses battery temperature measurements to learn a model that allows adapting to changes in the internal thermal calibration parameters. Our method is particularly effective in continuous sensing where the device casing the camera is prone to heating. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through controlled benchmark experiments which show significant improvements in thermal monitoring accuracy and robustness.},

abstract={Stress is a negative emotion that is part of everyday life. However, frequent episodes or prolonged periods of stress can be detrimental to long-term health. Nevertheless, developing self-awareness is an important aspect of fostering effective ways to self-regulate these experiences. Mobile lifelogging systems provide an ideal platform to support self-regulation of stress by raising awareness of negative emotional states via continuous recording of psychophysiological and behavioral data. However, obtaining meaningful information from large volumes of raw data represents a significant challenge because these data must be accurately quantified and processed before stress can be detected. This work describes a set of algorithms designed to process multiple streams of lifelogging data for stress detection in the context of real world driving. Two data collection exercises have been performed where multimodal data, including raw cardiovascular activity and driving information, were collected from 21 people during daily commuter journeys. Our approach enabled us to 1) pre-process raw physiological data to calculate valid measures of heart rate variability, a significant marker of stress, 2) identify/correct artefacts in the raw physiological data, and 3) provide a comparison between several classifiers for detecting stress. Results were positive and ensemble classification models provided a maximum accuracy of 86.9 percent for binary detection of stress in the real-world.},

abstract={Owing to the pervasive use of displays and smartphones, mobile interactions with display screens have gained attention within the advertising and gaming industries as well as in human-computer interaction research. Communication through QR code-like markers and localization via AR markers are common examples of such interactions. However, these visible markers interfere with the display content; this problem is critical for localization over a wide range of interactions, and fewer markers result in less reliability and accuracy. Although some studies have addressed this issue, few have focused on near-screen interaction without additional hardware. To address this problem, we propose an easy-to-install localization method that uses an array of AR markers, which are made imperceptible to the human eye through chromaticity vibration at 30 Hz. We mainly focus on applications, such as digital signage, where users point their smartphones at the display content. Through four evaluations, we confirm that the pointing error is within 1 mm, and that the proposed system works, when the distance between the screen and smartphone is 4-24 times the size of the AR marker. In addition, we establish that our system is robust against rotation. Finally, we present two potential application scenarios, advertising and navigation.},

Current systems are not personalized, they usually provide only a general information on sightseeing spot and do not concern about the tourist's perception of it. To design more adjustable and context-aware system, we focus on collecting and estimating emotions and satisfaction level, those tourists experience during the sightseeing tour. We reducing changes in their behaviour by collecting two types of information: conscious (short videos with impressions) and unconscious (behavioural pattern recorded with wearable devices) continuously during the whole tour. We have conducted experiments and collected initial data to build the prototype system. For each sight of the tour, participants provided an emotion and satisfaction labels. We use them to train unimodal neural network based models, fuse them together and get the final prediction for each recording. As tourist himself is the only source of labels for such system, we introduce an approach of post-experimental label correction, based on paired comparison. Such system built together allows us to use different modalities or their combination to perform real-time tourist emotion recognition and satisfaction estimation in-the-wild, bringing touristic guidance systems to the new level.},

abstract={Existing pervasive computing applications entail high degrees of communication, but existing deployments by and large rely on either a backend Internet connection to support communication or provide only one-way distribution of data (e.g., via environmental beacons). However, the pervasiveness of sensing, computation, and communication has changed the landscape of potential pervasive crowd applications. The plain “chattiness” of our everyday environments opens broad new possibilities for pervasive computing devices to opportunistically leverage each other, where the potential capability of a whole opportunistic crowd is much larger than the sum of its individuals' capabilities. In this talk, I will present both concrete motivating application domains and technical capabilities and constraints that lead us to consider the potential of direct device-to-device collaboration in support of crowd applications in pervasive computing. Drawing on my group's work in collaborative, opportunistic context-awareness, I will create a roadmap for research in support of a future vision of opportunistic crowds.},

abstract={Edge devices with sensing, storage, and communication resources are penetrating our daily lives. These resources make it possible for edge devices to conduct data transactions (e.g., micro-payments, micro-access control). The blockchain technology can be used to ensure transaction unmodifiable and undeniable. In this paper, we propose a blockchain system that adapts to the limitations of edge devices. The new blockchain system can fairly and efficiently allocate storage resources on edge devices, which makes it scalable. We find the optimal peer nodes for transaction data storage in the blockchain, and propose a recent block storage allocation scheme for quick retrieval of missing blocks. The proposed blockchain system can also reach mining consensus with low energy consumption in edge devices with a new Proof of Stake mechanism. Extensive simulations show that our proposed blockchain system works efficiently in edge environments. On average, the new system uses 15% less time and consumes 64% less battery power when compared with traditional blockchain systems.},

volume={},

pages={253-264},
abstract={Great public speakers are made, not born. Practicing a presentation in front of colleagues is common practice and results in a set of subjective judgements what could be improved. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a mobile app which estimates the quality of speaker's delivery in real time in a fair, repeatable and privacy-preserving way. Quantle estimates the speaker's pace in terms of the number of syllables, words and clauses, computes pitch and duration of pauses. The basic parameters are then used to estimate the talk complexity based on readability scores from the literature to help the speaker adjust his delivery to the target audience. In contrast to speech-to-text-based methods used to implement a digital presentation coach, Quantle does processing locally in real time and works in the flight mode. This design has three implications: (1) Quantle does not interfere with the surrounding hardware, (2) it is power-aware, since 95.2 % of the energy used by the app on iPhone 6 is spent to operate the built-in microphone and the screen, and (3) audio data and processing results are not shared with a third party therewith preserving speaker's privacy. We evaluate Quantle on artificial, online and live data. We artificially modify an audio sample by changing the volume, speed, tempo, pitch and noise level to test robustness of Quantle and its performance limits. We then test Quantle on 1017 TED talks held in English and compare computed features to those extracted from the available transcript processed by online text evaluation services. Quantle estimates of syllable and word counts are 85.4 % and 82.8 % accurate, and pitch is over 90 % accurate. We use the outcome of this study to extract typical ranges for each vocal characteristic. We then use Quantle on live data at a social event, and as a tool for speakers to track their delivery when rehearsing a talk. Our results confirm that Quantle is robust to different noise levels, varying distances from the sound source, phone orientation, and achieves comparable performance to speech-to-text methods.},

abstract={Recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs) is an enabling technology for several ubiquitous computing applications. Most activity recognition systems rely on supervised learning to extract activity models from labeled datasets. A problem with that approach is the acquisition of comprehensive activity datasets, which is an expensive task. The problem is particularly challenging when focusing on complex ADLs characterized by large variability of execution. Moreover, several activity recognition systems are limited to offline recognition, while many applications claim for online activity recognition. In this paper, we propose POLARIS, a framework for unsupervised activity recognition. POLARIS can recognize complex ADLs exploiting the semantics of activities, context data, and sensors. Through ontological reasoning, our algorithm derives semantic correlations among activities and sensor events. By matching observed events with semantic correlations, a statistical reasoner formulates initial hypotheses about the occurred activities. Those hypotheses are refined through probabilistic reasoning, exploiting semantic constraints derived from the ontology. Our system supports online recognition, thanks to a novel segmentation algorithm. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets show that the accuracy of our unsupervised method is comparable to the one of supervised approaches. Moreover, the online version of our system achieves essentially the same accuracy of the offline version.},

abstract={Human activity recognition plays a significant role in enabling pervasive applications as it abstracts low-level noisy sensor data into high-level human activities, which applications can respond to. With more and more activity-aware applications deployed in real-world environments, a research challenge emerges -- discovering and learning new activities that have not been pre-defined or observed in the training phase. This paper tackles this challenge by proposing a hierarchical mixture of directional statistical models. The model supports incrementally, continuously updating the activity model over time with the reduced annotation effort and without the need for storing historical sensor data. We have validated this solution on four publicly available, third-party smart home datasets, and have demonstrated up to 91.5 % accuracies of detecting and recognising new activities.},

abstract={Human activity recognition (HAR) from sensor readings has proved to be an effective approach in pervasive computing for smart healthcare. Recent approaches in ambient assisted living (AAL) within the home or community setting offers people the prospect of independent care and improved quality of living. However, most of the available AAL systems are limited by several factors including the system complexity and computational cost. In this paper, a simple, the novel ambient HAR framework using the multivariate Gaussian is proposed. The classification framework augments prior information from passive RFID tags to obtain more detailed activity profiling. The proposed algorithm based on the multivariate Gaussian via maximum likelihood estimation is used to learn the features of the human activity model. The twelve sequential and concurrent experimental evaluations are conducted in a mock apartment environment. The sampled activities are predicted using a new dataset of the same activity and high prediction accuracy established. The proposed framework suits well for the single and multi-dwelling environment and offers pervasive sensing environment for elderly, disabled, and carers.},

abstract={Advances in sensing and networking along with ubiquitous Internet connectivity have paved the way for today's massive Internet of Thing (IoT) market. Despite the vast potential of connecting to myriad devices across homes, office buildings, and public spaces, there is still a large need to unify the scattered protocols, hubs, and cloud services while personalizing enduser experiences. Enabling personalized IoT experiences requires an expressive and flexible middleware that enables simplified development of applications that address diverse individual needs and seamlessly cross multiple vendors and administrative domains. We introduce Warble: a middleware for such personalized IoT applications; Warble encapsulates device and protocol complexities, represents interaction with IoT devices as flexible programming abstractions, and enables applications to learn from their prior interactions in the IoT on behalf of their users. In this paper, we present Warble's architectural abstractions, API, and implementation. We then evaluate the middleware through a case study application using our Android implementation; this evaluation showcases the novelty of the Warble architecture and its programming abstractions.},

abstract={Inadvertent falls can cause serious, and potentially fatal injuries, to at risk individuals. One such community of at-risk individuals is the elderly population where age related complications, such as osteoporosis and dementia, can further increase the incidence and negative impact of such falls. Notably, falls within that community has been identified as the leading cause of injury related preventable death, hospitalization and reduction to quality of life. In such cases, rapid detection of, and reaction, to fall events has shown to be critical to reduce the negative effects of falls within this community. Currently, a range of fall detection solutions exist, however, they have several deficiencies related to the core approach that has been adopted. This study has developed an ensemble of thermal vision-based, big data facilitated, solutions which aim to address some of these deficiencies. An evaluation of these logical and data-driven processes has occurred with the promising results presented within this manuscript. Finally, opportunities future work and real-world evaluation have occurred and are underway.},

abstract={City services are frequently supported by software services that are managed by service-oriented architectures. However, a large number of software services is likely to cause performance issues when discovering software services. The distributed organisation of services information improves discovery performance. Existing research proposes to organise services information according to service location, domains, or city context, keeping that organisation constant under an assumption that cities do not change. However, cities are dynamic environments where entities interact, causing events that in turn, effect changes in the city. The organisation of services information must evolve or it will become outdated, negatively impacting discovery performance. We propose a self-adaptive service model for smart cities to support service discovery. This model adapts the organisation of services information according to city events. We introduce a self-adaptive architecture that keeps track of the discovery metrics and moves information about services between registries to maintain the discovery efficiency. We evaluate the proposed model in simulated environments and a real IoT testbed. Results show that our model outperforms competitors when reactive adaptation is triggered by a specific event. However, proactive adaptation needs further research. Results from the real IoT testbed present the costs of the proposed model.},

abstract={Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is a computational paradigm that enhances the use of computing devices by making them available to the user anywhere and anytime. From the energy perspective, it is often very important to compute the entire UbiComp task within a specific deadline with minimum energy. The literature on determining the energy consumption of the system for computing the task does not consider periodic tasks and different sampling rate of the sensors, which eliminates the deadline constraints in the analysis. Since the period of the tasks is not fixed, the estimated delay without considering the fixed period is lower than the actual value. In this paper, we assume that an Edge, Fog, and Cloud layers based UbiComp system computes the periodic task within the specific deadline. We derive the expressions of total delay and energy consumption of the UbiComp system. Using the derived expressions, we estimate fractions of the task that are computed at each layer to reduce the energy consumption such that the task is computed within a specific deadline. Our numerical and prototype results demonstrate the impact of the data size, network topologies, deadline, and characteristics of the sensors on the energy consumption, delay, and accuracy of the system.},

abstract={The growing use of mobile devices to support the teaching - learning process and their use in storing academic contents on virtual platforms, requires that systems oriented to the mobile learning take into consideration the educational context of students. One of the biggest challenges during the construction of these systems is the modeling of the context and the possibility of including ontology-based approaches in order to obtain a better structure of the information. Thus, this paper presents a mobile learning system that uses a network of ontologies, which allow the representation of the contextual dimensions of a teaching - learning environment (e.g., location, time, user profiles and knowledge areas). In addition, it is possible to take advantage of the use of semantic search (keywords)and route algorithms applied to ontological models due to their expressiveness and extensible architecture. This study looks for providing students and teachers with personalized and relevant academic information in their current context of study. Finally, as a first step towards an empirical evaluation, the proposed system has been tried into a real academic context by means of a quasi-experiment with six students. Here, the results show favorable perceptions from the participants about its usefulness. These results were obtained using the statistical tool ANOVA, and show a positive influence on the academic performance of the students.},
