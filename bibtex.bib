abstract = "Cycling in smart cities can be safer if enhanced with a smart traffic lights infrastructure. A distributed smartphone-based sensing approach is a cost-effective infrastructure to enable cyclist-aware traffic lights system. In this article, we treat cyclist movement on a trajectory with a Boundary model able to reduce GPS sensor power consumption, while performing time-of-arrival estimation to the nearest light. A global quantitative metric of model efficiency is proposed for assessing the overall behavior of the model, and a false-positives rating qualitative metric is used to assess the recall of the model. We evaluated the model with confined yet realistic cycling experiments and verify the precision of our model using an Android application installed in participants’ smartphones. We compared our model with previous literature, achieving a promising model for in-the-wild cycling scenarios."

The main idea of the Naked world is that all the services which are currently provided by gadgets will be provided by the infrastructure, thus no gadgets will be needed to use any kind of digital services. When a user in the Naked world intends to use a service, the infrastructure senses the user, the nearby intelligent surrounding launches an interactive user interface, performs identification through biometric identities, provides the service, and then closes the session when the user finishes the job. Therefore, the Naked world comprises highly intelligent and context-aware interactive environments. The vision of the Naked world is an evolution towards a user-friendly and ubiquitously available digital services, which is naturally bounded by the technological advancement. Henceforth, this paper presents the essential technologies and functional requirements along with the current and forthcoming novel technological concepts and challenges for the realization of the Naked world."

However, fairly little attention has been devoted to the design of ubiquitous computing approaches for spontaneous exploration of large information spaces enabling co-located collaboration. We investigate whether an entity-based user interface provides a solution to support co-located search on heterogeneous devices. We present the design and implementation of QueryTogether, a multi-device collaborative search tool through which entities such as people, documents, and keywords can be used to compose queries that can be shared to a public screen or specific users with easy touch enabled interaction. We conducted mixed-methods user experiments with twenty seven participants (nine groups of three people), to compare the collaborative search with QueryTogether to a baseline adopting established search and collaboration interfaces. Results show that QueryTogether led to more balanced contribution and search engagement. While the overall s-recall in search was similar, in the QueryTogether condition participants found most of the relevant results earlier in the tasks, and for more than half of the queries avoided text entry by manipulating recommended entities. The video analysis demonstrated a more consistent common ground through increased attention to the common screen, and more transitions between collaboration styles. Therefore, this provided a better fit for the spontaneity of ubiquitous scenarios. QueryTogether and the corresponding study demonstrate the importance of entity based interfaces to improve collaboration by facilitating balanced participation, flexibility of collaboration styles and social processing of search entities across conversation and devices. The findings promote a vision of collaborative search support in spontaneous and ubiquitous multi-device settings, and better linking of conversation objects to searchable entities."

Simulations and experiments using a real WSN testbed, were performed to validate our protocol. Results show that the proposed mechanisms solve the WSN configuration problems, in noisy and interference environments, and enable the coexistence with different networks and devices operating in the same frequency spectrum, while maintaining application requirements in critical deployment scenarios."

To achieve efficient authorized communication, multi-server based authentication protocols have been designed. The key feature of multi-server based protocols is one time registration. We study the existing multi-server based authentication protocols, and identify that many of the multi-server based authentication protocols involve control server in mutual authentication or trusted server environment is required. The involvement of central authority in mutual authentication may be a bottleneck for large network, and the servers may be semi-trusted. To erase these drawbacks, Wei et al. recently proposed a multi-server based authentication protocol. Their protocol does not require all servers to be trusted and involvement of control server in mutual authentication. Unfortunately, we identify the security vulnerability of Wei et al.'s scheme to insider attack and password guessing attack. Additionally, lack of pre-smart card authentication leads to denial of service attack. To enhance the security of Wei et al.'s protocol, we propose a secure biometric-based authentication scheme for multi-server environment using smart card. We simulate the proposed protocol for the formal security verification using the widely accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our scheme is secure against active and passive attacks. In addition, we prove that our proposed scheme provides mutual authentication using the widely-accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and is also secured against various well known attacks. In addition, our scheme is efficient in terms of computational and communication overheads as compared to Wei et al.'s scheme and other existing related schemes."

The way in which this information is presented, and especially when it is presented, may make it difficult for the intensivists within intense healthcare units to understand a patient's state in a timely fashion. Should there be a need to cross various types of clinical data from various sources, the situation worsens considerably. To support the health professional's decision-making process, the Pervasive Business Intelligence (PBI) Systems are a forthcoming field. Based on this principle, the current study approaches the way to present information about the patients, after they are received in a BI system, making them available at any place and at any time for the intensivists that may need it for the decision-making. The patient's history will, therefore, be available, allowing examination of the vital signs data, what medicine that they might need, health checks performed, among others. Then, it is of vital importance, to make these conclusions available to the health professionals every time they might need, so as to aid them in the decision-making. This study aims to make a stance by approaching the theme of PBI in Critical Healthcare. The main objective is to understand the underlying concepts and the assets of BI solutions with Pervasive characteristics. Perhaps consider it a sort of guide or a path to follow for those who wish to insert Pervasive into Business Intelligence in Healthcare area."

We do this to contribute both evidence and theory regarding the concept of a sociotechnical assemblage that serves as the innovation network. Advancing a sociotechnical conceptualization of innovation focuses attention on the contributions of, and linkages among, different types of actors; individuals and organizations, visions and concepts, and technological artifacts and prototypes together create a means for innovation to occur. The empirical basis for this theorizing comes from a detailed study of the community of research scientists, faculty, and graduate students; institutions such as research labs, funding sources, and product companies who were (and mostly still are) involved in tabletop computing.

Moreover, a sensor-packed manufacturing system in which each process or piece of equipment makes available event and status information, coupled with market research for true advanced Big Data analytics, seem to be the right ingredients for event response selection and operation virtualization. As a drawback, the resulting manufacturing cyber-physical system will be vulnerable to the inevitable cyber-attacks, unfortunately, so common for the software and Internet-based systems.

More specifically, we introduce two features that have not been previously considered in the literature: the content of URLs and hashtags appearing in tweets. We also employ distributed representations of words and phrases present in tweets, hashtags and URLs, pre-trained on appropriate corpora in order to exploit their semantic information in age prediction.

One important step in this setting is the Preference Elicitation task which consists in providing the user ways to inform his/her choice on pairs of objects with a minimal effort. In this paper we propose an automatic preference elicitation method based on mining techniques. The method consists in extracting a user profile from a set of user preference samples. In our setting, a profile is specified by a set of contextual preference rules verifying properties of soundness and conciseness. After proving that the problem is NP-complete, we propose a resolution in 2 phases. The first phase extracts all individual user preferences by means of contextual preference rules. The second phase builds the user profile starting from this collection of rules using a greedy method. To assess the quality of user profiles, we propose three ranking techniques benefiting from these profiles that enable us to rank objects according to user preferences. We evaluate the efficacy of our three ranking strategies and compare them with a well-known ranking method (SVMRank). The evaluation is carried out through an extensive set of experiments executed on a real-world database of user preferences about movies."

abstract = "The key role of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve manufacturing productivity within the paradigm of factory of the future is often proved. These tools are used in a wide range of product lifecycle activities, from the early design phase to product recycling. Generally, the assistance tools are mainly dedicated to the management board and fewer initiatives focus on the operational needs of the worker at the shop-floor level. This paper proposes a context-aware knowledge-based system dedicated to support the actors of the factory by the right information at the right time and in the appropriate format regarding their context of work and level of expertise. Particularly, specific assistance functionalities are dedicated to the workers in charge of the machine configuration and the realization of manufacturing operations. PGD-based (Proper Generalized Decomposition) algorithms are used for real time simulation of industrial processes and machine configuration. At the conceptual level, a semantic model is proposedas key enablersfor the structuration of the knowledge-based system."

There are various kinds of data processing techniques such as compression or coding to improve the transmission efficiency for heterogeneous networks with different requirements. However, the methods for improving fault tolerance in ubiquitous communication systems are still lacked especially for the multimedia data driven applications at the execution ends. In this paper, we propose an image content recovery method for JPEG images that can recover the image content by estimating the DC coefficients without any pre-know knowledge. This method can also be used to transmit the rough image content by reducing the data amount needed to be transmitted. Thus, fault tolerance can be achieved at the receivers’ ends for ubiquitous communication systems. The result analysis with different images compared with previous works proved the effectiveness of our method."

For such systems, new communication technologies are constructed to cope with the increasing functional and temporal demans. Because of the ubiquitousness of mobile devices nowadays, for example, traditional publish/subscribe is no longer an adequate model for data dissemination in mobile networks. Since any node can publish content at any time, the network can get congested easily, so a dissemination paradigm where mobile nodes contribute with a fraction of their resources is needed, through the use of opportunistic networks. Furthermore, a suitable organization for data dissemination in mobile networks should be centered around interests. Thus, we propose a unified interest-based dissemination framework for opportunistic networks entitled Interest Spaces, which simplifies dissemination by just allowing applications to mark data items with certain tags, letting the framework handle the caching, routing, forwarding, and disseminating. Similarly, applications that need to subscribe to channels simply have to specify the tags they are interested in, and the framework does the rest. However, the Interest Spaces framework also allows applications to have more control over the dissemination process if they wish, by specifying various criteria and dissemination rules. In this article, we present the architecture and components of Interest Spaces. We focus on data aggregation at the context layer, showing through simulations the benefits it brings in opportunistic dissemination. We also present a real-life use case for Interest Spaces through Chatty, an opportunistic chat application."

To connect such different models, we propose a framework for managing context-aware services executed at pervasive computing and cloud computing. The framework is constructed as a world model for specifying contextual information in the real world. This paper describes the design and prototype implementation of the proposed model."

To address this need, we develop a new potential function, namely 3DIGARS3.0, which is a linearly weighted combination of 3DIGARS, mined accessible surface area (ASA) and ubiquitously computed Phi (uPhi) and Psi (uPsi) energies – optimized by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). We use a dataset of 4332 protein-structures to generate uPhi and uPsi based score libraries to be used within the core 3DIGARS method. The optimized weight of each component is obtained by applying Genetic Algorithm based optimization on three challenging decoy sets. The improved 3DIGARS3.0 outperformed state-of-the-art methods significantly based on a set of independent test datasets."

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach."

One of the methodological decisions faced by researchers is deciding on the question scheduling. The literature defines three distinct schedule types: randomised, interval-based, or event-based (in our case, smartphone unlock). However, little evidence exists regarding the side-effects of these schedules on response rate and recall accuracy, and how they may bias study findings. We evaluate the effect of these three contingency configurations in a 3-week within-subjects study (N = 20). Participants answered various objective questions regarding their phone usage, while we simultaneously establish a ground-truth through smartphone instrumentation. We find that scheduling questions on phone unlock yields a higher response rate and accuracy. Our study provides empirical evidence for the effects of notification scheduling on participant responses, and informs researchers who conduct experience sampling studies on smartphones."

In fact, innovative mobile technologies provide new tools (apps) which are able to separate the moment of purchase from the moment of effective consumption, by allowing consumers to make purchases by mobile phone and collect them at home or at a store (a pick-up boutique or collection point), in addition to the traditional in-store service (purchase in the store and collect/consume in the store). The aim of this paper is to understand the extent to which mobile technologies have an impact on consumer behaviour, with emphasis on the drivers motivating consumers to adopt the consumer experience of mobile shopping. To achieve this goal we used a qualitative approach involving 29 consumers in the Italian market, where mobile shopping is still at an early stage. The findings shed a light on the extent to which consumers are moving from e-channels to mobile channels and take into account the effect of these technological innovations in retail settings from a cognitive standpoint, where studies are limited. The implications for researchers and practitioners are then discussed, with emphasis on retailers need to develop new mobile service competences, and integrate and synthetize physical retail settings with mobile opportunities and functionalities."

The concept of context awareness emerged as a possible key-factor for both performance optimization and operational adaptation of the capture, extraction, matching and decision stages. This may be particularly effective for multi-biometrics systems. The knowledge of the context in which a task is being performed, may provide useful information to the system in several manners. For example, it may allow to adapt to a specific environmental condition, such as shadow or light exposure. On the other hand, it may be possible to select the best available algorithm, among a given set to address the task at hand, which best performs within the given context. This paper aims to provide an overall vision of the main contributions available so far in the field of context-aware biometric systems and methods. The survey is not confined to a particular biometric modality or processing stage, but rather spans the state of the art of several biometric modalities and approaches. A taxonomy of context-aware biometric systems and methods is also proposed, along with a comparison of their features, aims and performances. The analysis will be complemented with a critical discussion about the state of the art also suggesting some future application scenarios."

abstract = "Ephemeral computing is a term that describes computing systems whose nodes or their connectivity have an ephemeral, heterogeneous and possibly also unpredictable nature. These properties will affect the functioning of distributed versions of computer algorithms. Such algorithms, which are usually straightforward extensions of sequential algorithms, will have to be redesigned and, in many cases, rethought from the ground up, to be able to use all ephemerally available resources. Porting algorithms to an inherently ephemeral, unreliable and massively heterogeneous computing substrate is thus one of the main challenges in the ephemeral computing field. Algorithms adapted so that they can be consciously running on this kind of environments require specific properties in terms of flexibility, plasticity and robustness. Bioinspired algorithms are particularly well suited to this endeavor, thanks to their decentralized functioning, intrinsic parallelism, resilience, adaptiveness, and amenability for being endowed with algorithmic components dealing with both the massive complexity of the computational substrate and that of the problem being tackled. Arranging these components and functionalities in a collection of algorithmic strata results in deep architectures, whereby different layers of optimization are organized into loosely-coupled hierarchies that not only are able to use ephemeral computing environments, but also profit from them by making adaptivity and diversity maintenance features of the algorithm. Moreover, the synergies that arise when these massively heterogeneous computing resources are made available to deep versions of bioinspired algorithms may enable hard real-world problems and applications to be successfully faced in the Big Data context (including but not limited to social data analysis) as well as problems in the areas of computational creativity or computer gaming."

For the further improvement of the model, in this study, we propose Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network model for urban vehicle trajectory prediction. In this proposed model, we use attention mechanism to incorporate network traffic state data into urban vehicle trajectory prediction. The model is evaluated by using the Bluetooth data collected in Brisbane, Australia, which contains the movement information of private vehicles.

Trails are historical records of users’ displacements that can be used to develop strategic accessibility solutions, such as security management and recommendation through inferences on behavior. TrailCare contributions are the indoor/outdoor trail-aware strategy and its application to recommend contextualized accessibility resources. The system was implemented and integrated with a motorized wheelchair manufactured by a Brazilian company. The prototype is a complete and functional system based on one of the most used wheelchair models in Brazil. TrailCare was assessed through three practical experiments involving scenarios in a university campus. The first two experiments aimed to evaluate the system functionalities. They consisted of two scenarios that tested practical situations supported by the technologies of context awareness and indoor/outdoor trail awareness. The third experiment focused on evaluating the user experience with the system. It comprised a scenario that was followed by 10 wheelchair users, who were observed by researchers regarding usability aspects. The users also filled out a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The survey was composed by 10 sentences and the results of each one are discussed. The experiments allowed us to learn 10 relevant lessons about technological and usability aspects of the TrailCare that are recorded in this article. The results also showed 96% of acceptance regarding perceived ease of use and 98% in perceived usefulness. The results of experiments showed the potential for implementing TrailCare in real-life situations, allowing the use of ubiquitous technologies to support accessibility for wheelchair users."

Techniques for recognizing atomic activities such as gestures or actions are mature for now, but complex activity recognition still remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we address the problem of complex activity recognition using time series extracted from multiple sensors. We first build a dictionary of time series patterns, called shapelets, to represent atomic activities, then present three shapelet-based models to recognize sequential, concurrent, and generic complex activities. We use the datasets collected from three different labs to evaluate our shapelet-based approach and the results show that our approach can handle complex activity recognition effectively. Our experimental results also show that the shapelet-based approach outperforms other competing approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and system usage."

From the viewpoint, it is very important for us to know the various types of support that teachers need. In this study, we focused on teachers’ mental situations when they produce educational materials for their classrooms. We aimed to establish a model, so that the data of eye blinking could be analyzed and applied to evaluate teachers’ psychological and mental situations. Using a commercial glass-type sensor to observe eye blinking behaviors, we measured them for three teachers (as examinees), while they were producing their own presentation files. The data for the blinking behaviors were compared with the concentration power index and analyzed.

Indeed, they sustain development of numerous paradigms/ technologies such as distributed ambient intelligence, context-awareness and future mobile networking (e.g., B4G and 5G). Battery life remains one of the crucial problems to handle. In this article we propose an infrastructure-based topology using mobile ferries (mobile micro-base stations). In real life, a ferry could be robot, bus, tram, train or any other engine scrutinizing periodically a given area. Yet, message ferries are moving along concentric annulus and may collect data generated by the static sensors (could be classic sensors, smart meters, wearable devices, etc.) randomly distributed on given area. Next, transmissions are performed in a ferry-to-ferry forwarding scheme till arriving at the sink. Considered ferries could sense themselves data and therefore behave as mobile sensors allowing better awareness on the area state [1], [2], [3]. Our scheme could also assist Machine-to-Machine communications to increase the network lifetime, with potentially some cognitive-radio capabilities and opportunistic detection and access. Our proposal can easily be integrated in a smart-city for better interaction and green communications. Next, we present a queueing model (queues with finite capacity) to handle the generated traffic and to analyze the behavior of mobile ferries. We provided a close-form expression for both end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. The main objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of the cognitive sensors by asking cognitive sensors to not care about forwarding data of each other except for urgent data, this latter point is out of the scope of the paper. These static sensors will only care about data sensing, which will reduce their individual energy consumption."

Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical.
Objective
To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions.
Methods
38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking (>4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men).
Results
Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed).
Conclusions
Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness."

Moreover, the stream of data communication through WSNs is continuously increasing in volume. Such huge amounts of data are targeted by attackers frequently, and thus it is crucial to provide high-level security to ensure safe and effective communication of information through the Internet. In order to secure data communication over the Internet through WSNs, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) must be provided as an essential component in networks, databases and cloud systems. Over the previous decade, various approaches were utilized for developing IDSs. Unfortunately, however,none of these systems are completely flawless due to uncertainty surrounding network traffic created by normal users and attackers. Hence, the need to develop efficient IDSs has increased continuously. The present study proposes an adaptive IDS based on Fuzzy Rough sets for attribute selection and Allen’s interval algebra, which is applied on network trace datasets in order to select a huge number of attack data for effective prediction of attacks in WSNs. In addition, a fuzzy and rough set based nearest neighborhood algorithm (FRNN) is proposed in this article for effective classification of network trace dataset. This model uses a biased dataset that has 50:50 normal and attack data as opposed to the conventional datasets that have 80:20 normal and attack data. The efficiency of the proposed IDS is increased due to the use of biased data. The combination of feature selection, temporal-based dataset selection, and classification using a biased dataset reduces the false alarm rate and increases detection accuracy."

In the world of ubiquitous computing, fuzzy logic has been emerged as an important research area in the field of face recognition (FR) applications. In this paper, a new efficient and advanced method; inspired from interval type-II fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy logic is proposed. The motivation behind our method is to exploit the benefit of an extended interval type-II membership function: a new concept to fuzzy logics; in collaboration with kernel based sparse representation for FR. To integrate all the pluton, we propose a method called: extended interval type-II and kernel based sparse representation method (ExIntTy2KBSRM). In our proposed method, first we figure out the measure of participation of individual pixels in identifying face images using a variant of Interval type-II fuzzy logic i.e. extended interval type-II membership function in place of type 1 fuzzy logic. Next, we calculate K nearest neighbor to training specimens using simple Euclidean distance metric for sparse representation of each test specimen as a combinatorial of calculated K nearest training specimens. After this, we do classification based on contribution made by calculated train specimens in representation results. The efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed method is shown based on experiments performed on various standard databases. The experimental results show that our method deal with challenges of face recognition more efficiently as compared to other state of art methods, as it integrates the pluton of two different membership function based extended interval type-II fuzzy logics in collaboration with kernel sparse representation. Also, our experimental analysis tells that our proposed method improves the classification accuracy to 2–10% greater than the other existing relevant methods. Impact and significance of the proposed method: The main impact of the proposed method in FR based expert and intelligent systems is that, it considers unseen information available in pixel values of a face image present due to non-linear variations and overlapping of pixels. It also contains the advantage of spatial similar structure information present in face images. This makes the system more effective and efficient in processing face images for FR. Our method also works where Gaussian membership function does not work and discretizes linear and non-linear functions appropriately. Thus, the proposed method is universally applicable to solve more challenges of FR viz. illumination, occlusion, expression etc. and also has application in other areas viz. medical image processing, decision making problems, hand written words recognition, speech processing, watermarking etc. Also, our method makes FR systems computationally more efficient and cost effective by using sparse concept to matrices, which makes system to consume less memory and process data faster."

Due to the characteristics of diversity and uncertainty in daily living applications, most existing complex activity recognition approaches have notable limitations. First, graphical model-based approaches still lack sufficient expressive power to model rich temporal relations among activities. Second, it would be rather difficult for graphical model-based approaches to build a unified model for achieving multiple types of tasks. Third, current semantic-based approaches often fail to capture uncertainties. Fourth, formulae in these semantic-based approaches are often manually encoded. Meanwhile, it is impractical to handcraft each formula accurately in daily living scenarios where temporal relations among activities are intricate. To address these issues, we present a probabilistic semantic-based framework that combines Markov logic network with 15 temporal and hierarchical relations to explicitly perform diverse inference tasks of daily living in a unified manner. Advanced pattern mining techniques are introduced to automatically learn the propositional logic rules of intricate relations as well as their weights. Experimental results show that by logical reasoning with the mined temporal dependencies under uncertainty, the proposed model leads to an improved performance, particularly when recognizing complex activities involving the incomplete or incorrect observations of atomic actions."

Engagement in vertical discourse enables students to transcend an immediate context to examine social classifications and control mechanisms that are inherent in pedagogical discourse. In the process, both education and technologies integrated into the curriculum are revealed to be ideologically charged. To illustrate this, I use the example of the study of augmented reality in a Postgraduate Certificate of Applied Practice. I then make suggestions regarding engagement in vertical discourse, so that practising teachers enrolled in the course are enabled to recognise and engage with the classifications and control mechanisms inherent in technological discourse. Finally, I suggest that engagement in vertical discourse is not an inevitable aspect of 21st Century learning design. Rather, engagement in vertical discourse and access to powerful knowledge have to be incorporated consciously in learning design by teachers who are familiar with the territory."

There exist significant differences when work is conducted in groups via video beam and time is longer when desktop is used. Also, work time is longer with “Wall” interface.

Also, the massive amount of data generated by sensors and smart objects led to a new kind of services known as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS). The quality of these services is highly dependent on the quality of sensed data (QoD), which is characterized by a number of quality attributes. DaaS provisioning is typically governed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between data consumers and DaaS providers. In this work, we propose a game-based approach for DaaS Provisioning, which relies on signaling based model for the negotiation of several QoD attributes between DaaS providers and data consumers. We consider that these entities are adaptive, rational, and able to negotiate the QoD offering even in the case of incomplete information about the other party. We use in the negotiation between the two parties a Q-learning algorithm for the signaling model and a Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) model to select the best signal. Moreover, we empirically validate the MADM model using Shannon’s entropy. The results obtained in the case of a multi-stages negotiation scenario show the convergence towards the pooling equilibrium."

abstract = "Current technology offers a variety of ways for context-aware information delivery to mobile users. The most challenging aspect, however, is to determine what the user is interested in. The user’s position is the best available hint, but if we know what the user is looking at and what his or her gazing profile is, we can narrow down the possibly relevant objects of interest. With the advent of mobile and ubiquitous computing, it is time to explore the potential of mobile eye tracking technology for natural, intelligent interactions between users and their smart environment, not only for specific tasks, but also for the more ambitious goal of integrating eye tracking into the process of inferring mobile users’ interests, for the purpose of providing them with relevant services, a research area that has received little attention so far. In this work, we examine the potential of integrating a mobile eye tracker, as a natural interaction device, into an audio guide system for museum visitors. Using it as a pointing device enables the system to reason unobtrusively about the user’s focus of attention and to deliver relevant information about it as needed. To realize this goal, we integrated an image-matching based technique for indoor positioning and an eye-gaze detection technique to identify the user’s focus of attention into two different versions of a mobile audio guide: (1) a proactive version that delivers information automatically whenever user interest is detected, and (2) a reactive version that notifies the user about the availability of this information, thus giving the user more control over information delivery. Furthermore, we developed a conventional museum visitors’ mobile guide system using a smartphone and low-energy Bluetooth beacons for positioning; this guide was used as a reference system. The three museum visitors’ guides were evaluated in realistic settings at the Hecht1 1 http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/Default_eng.aspx.Museum, a small museum, located at the University of Haifa that has both archeological and art collections. The experimental evaluation compared the contribution of the three versions of the audio guide to the visit experience. The results showed that the mobile eye tracking technology, although unfamiliar, and perhaps even immature, was accepted by the participants. The mobile eye tracker audio guide was perceived as preferable to the conventional museum mobile guide, especially with regard to learning during the visit. Furthermore, with regard to proactivity in context-aware systems, the results showed that the participants like to be in control, and that most of them preferred the reactive version of the mobile eye tracker audio guide over the proactive one."

By using bibliometric indexes the results found here can be replicated, complemented and extended in a systematic way, incrementing its utility. The study examines the growth pattern of research in adaptivity, and identifies its top areas; types of publications; and contributing countries and organizations. The review also revealed the value for some of the parameters needed to develop more specialized analysis in adaptivity, such as: scope, timespan, search space and databases. Finally, we propose several analysis to be performed in future works to complement the previous results. This work is, to our knowledge, the first bibliometric review conducted for the subject matter of adaptive behavior."

abstract = "Querying any point-of-interest (POI) in anywhere is a major part of location-based services (LBS) and has been applied to diverse wireless and/or mobile networks for realizing seamless services and mobile and ubiquitous computing. In particular, designing an efficient query processing scheme is admittedly challenging in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) because of the lack of centralized coordination, limited computing and communication capabilities, and time-varying network topologies. Unlike traditional stationary POIs, it also becomes challenging to consider mobile POIs that can invalidate prior query result. To address these challenges, we propose a set of query processing strategies based on a validity region to efficiently update the freshness of the queried POI and reduce the query traffic in MANETs. We first present and analyze time- and location-sensitive query types in the presence of static and mobile POIs and identify their corresponding query processing operations and implications. A time-sensitive query targets a POI containing a time-varying information while a location-sensitive query retrieves a location information. In this paper, we focus on location-sensitive query for both static and mobile POIs. Unlike a static POI, which is stationary and never changes its location, a mobile POI refers to a moving object and its location information is time varying. Then we propose basic rectangle and convex hull based validity regions and their corresponding query processing operations, and extend them by combining both techniques and considering an opportunistic overhearing. We also propose two more techniques in forming validity region for mobile POIs and their corresponding query processing operations to flexibly approximate the validity region. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and analysis, in which an infrastructure-based query processing approach is modified to work in MANETs for performance comparison. The simulation results indicate that the validity region based query processing strategies can reduce the number of queries and increase the time staying in the validity region."

This paper aims to contribute to this topic through a systematic and rigorous activity based on two main pillars of the empirical research in software engineering: i) a literature review addressing design and evaluation of tools for smart home control oriented to end users, and ii) an experimental study in which three tools, that emerged from the literature review as the most suitable and widespread, were compared in order to identify the interaction mechanisms that end users appreciate most.

This paper examines consumer behavior responses while using a mobile instant messaging (MIM) channel adopted by a Chinese pure-play retailer. MIM is text-based, mobile computer-mediated communication technology accomplishing real-time interaction with other users. WeChat, a full service MIM application, contains functional and social features including SMS, LBS, voice message, video calls and "Moments" sharing, which is its social propagating feature. There is a paucity of literature on the role of MIM in building relationships and the relevance of emotion and WOM for consumers engaging in MIM interactions. The model was derived from prior research on Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) that depicts the effects of environmental/informational stimuli on consumers' responses. Research objectives included investigating the prediction that environmental stimuli comprising socialness perception, media richness, and involvement induce a positive emotional state, which results in positive WOM. The study employed a quantitative approach. The sample comprised young Chinese WeChat users (n = 486). SEM was used to analyse the data. Prior research has indicated that building relationships with consumers is more difficult when the relationships are consumer-computer as compared to consumer-person. The findings of this study suggest that such a negative effect can be alleviated by the use of MIM. This study is original in integrating socialness perception, media richness and WOM into the SOR framework. The implications for practitioners are discussed, including retailers' need to be aware of the extent to which consumers are willing to engage with MIM applications."

Context-aware systems are able to change their behaviour depending on new conditions regarding the user, the platform and the environment. These systems are evolving towards interacting with the user in a transparent and ubiquitous manner, especially by means of different types of sensors, which can gather a wide range of data from the user, the platform the user is interacting with, and the environment where such interaction is taking place. It is worth noting that the software architecture of a system is a key artefact during its development and its adaptation process. Hence, the definition of the software architecture becomes essential while developing context-aware systems since it should reflect how the context is tackled for adaptation purposes. With the aim of studying this issue, we have designed and conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview about the different architectural approaches used in context-aware systems. One of the main findings of this study is that there are not many software architecture proposals that deal with context-awareness in an explicit way during the adaptation process. It was also detected that there are Human Computer Interaction (HCI) works that focus on context-aware adaptations but neglect partially or completely any possible change in the system architecture during the adaptation process. Due to this, we perceived a need to analyse what research works highlight the use of context and its relationship to the software architecture in existing context-aware systems. Therefore, this mapping study attempts to bridge the gap between Software Architecture and HCI in order to align the adaptation at the architectural level (changes in the configuration of architectural components) and at the HCI level (changes in the interaction modality or the user interface in general)."

Sadly, there do not exist promising options for paralyzed people to interact with the machine, i.e., laptops, smartphones, and notepads. A few commercial solutions such as Google Glasses are costly and cannot be afforded by every paralyzed person to interact with the machine. Towards this end, the paper proposes a retina-controlled device called EyeCom. The proposed device is constructed from off-the-shelf cost-effective yet robust IoT devices (i.e., Arduino microcontrollers, Xbee wireless sensors, infrared light emitting (IR) diodes, and accelerometer). The EyeCom can be easily mounted on to the glasses. The paralyzed person using this device can interact with the machine, using simple head movements and eye blinks. The IR detector is located in front of the EyeCom to illuminate the eye region. As a result of the illumination, the eye reflects the IR light, which includes electrical signals. As eyelids close, the reflected light, over all of the eye surface is disrupted, and the change in reflected value is recorded. On the other hand, to enable cursor movement onto the computer screen on behalf of the paralyzed person a device named accelerometer is used. A microcontroller processes the inputs from the IR sensors and accelerometer and transmit them wirelessly via Xbee wireless sensor (i.e., a radio) to another microcontroller attached to the computer. With the help of the proposed algorithm, the microcontroller attached to the computer, on receiving the signal moves the cursor onto the computer screen and facilitate performing actions, as simple as opening a document, to operating a word-to-speech software."

This paper proposes an approach to synchronize the trajectory data of people by interpolation based on Catmull-Rom Spline. The optimal interpolating points are computed based on our proposed error function. Moreover, we propose an approach to assign the groups proper colors and then uses the hot map to show the dynamic changes of groups graphically. A real-life data set is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that 97.9% accuracy of group recognition can be achieved and the dynamic changes of groups is well shown."

In WSN, optimization and load balancing of network resources are critical concern to provide the intelligence for long duration. Since clustering the sensor nodes can significantly enhance overall system scalability and energy efficiency this paper presents a distributed cluster head scheduling (DCHS) algorithm to achieve the network longevity in WSN. The major novelty of this work is that the network is divided into primary and secondary tiers based on received signal strength indication of sensor nodes from the base station. The proposed DCHS supports for two tier WSN architecture and gives suggestion to elect the cluster head nodes and gateway nodes for both primary and secondary tiers. The DCHS mechanism satisfies an ideal distribution of the cluster head among the sensor nodes and avoids frequent selection of cluster head, based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and residual energy level of the sensor nodes. Since the RSSI is the key parameter for this paper, the practical experiment was conducted to measure RSSI value by using MSP430F149 processor and CC2500 transceiver. The measured RSSI values were given input to the event based simulator to test the DCHS mechanism. The real time experimental study validated the proposed scheme for various scenarios."

Most modern public and residential buildings are planned with the objective of decreasing expenses by reducing energy consumption. Enhancing energy preservation strategies and using sustainable design approaches are necessary factors in developing this field. However, many definitions of 'intelligent buildings' are vague and don't mirror all the parameters. Because of the lack of practical context inclusive of the factors that regard the design of such systems, a comprehensive framework containing the convoluted criteria is demanded as a decision-making tool. In this research, a multi-criteria framework composed of sixty-eight sub factors on the core level is proposed as a comprehensive tool for the selective categorization of intelligent buildings. On the secondary level, eight quality condition components are considered as primary factors alongside the factors of energy and environment, space flexibility, cost-effectiveness, client comfort, working efficiency, safety, culture, and technology. By the end of this research, the final findings will endorse the usage of intelligent buildings from two points of view: The first includes a multi-criteria model used to define all factors involved in the design process, and the second proposes a conceptual model which aids in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions."

The methodology uses TEMS Investigation software to retrieve network information including signal strength and cell-identities of various base transmitter stations (BTS). The distances from the mobile station (MS) to each BTS are therefore generated using Walfish-Ikigami radio propagation model. The performances of the established hybrid estimator −fuzzy extended Kalman filter (FEKF)- are compared with extended Kalman filter approach and fuzzy-control based approach.

abstract = "Social media have emerged in the last decade as a viable and ubiquitous means of communication. The ease of user content generation within these platforms, e.g. check-in information, multimedia data, etc., along with the proliferation of Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled, always-connected capture devices lead to data streams of unprecedented amount and a radical change in information sharing. Social data streams raise a variety of practical challenges, including derivation of real-time meaningful insights from effectively gathered social information, as well as a paradigm shift for content distribution with the leverage of contextual data associated with user preferences, geographical characteristics and devices in general. In this article we present a comprehensive survey that outlines the state-of-the-art situation and organizes challenges concerning social media streams and the infrastructure of the data centres supporting the efficient access to data streams in terms of content distribution, data diffusion, data replication, energy efficiency and network infrastructure. We systematize the existing literature and proceed to identify and analyse the main research points and industrial efforts in the area as far as modelling, simulation and performance evaluation are concerned."

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback."

This imposes restrictions on many aspects of the interaction.

We present five high-level categories of features of user authentication in the gadget-free world including security, privacy and usability aspects. These are adapted and extended from earlier research on web authentication methods. We survey existing authentication methods together with some emerging technologies and evaluate these according to the features in our categories. Our results show, that no single authentication method can realise all these requirements for authentication. In conclusion, we give future research directions and open problems that stem from our observations. Especially, finding combinations of authentication factors and methods that achieve all requirements is an interesting problem in the gadget-free scenario."

Such McSoC devices allow superior performance gains while side-stepping the power and heat dissipation limitations of clock frequency scaling. The main advantage lies in the exploitation of parallelism, distributively and massively. Consequently, the on-chip communication fabric becomes the performance determinant. To bridge the widening gap between computation requirements and communication efficiency faced by gigascale McSoCs in the upcoming billion-transistor era, a new on-chip communication system, dubbed Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC), has been proposed by using the recently developed RF interconnect technology. With the high data-rate, low power and ultra-short range interconnection provided by UWB technology, the WiNoC design paradigm calls for effective solutions to overhaul the on-chip communication infrastructure of gigascale McSoCs. In this work, an irregular and reconfigurable WiNoC platform is proposed to tackle ever increasing complexity, density and heterogeneity challenges. A flexible RF infrastructure is established where RF nodes are properly distributed and IP cores are clustered. Consequently, a performance-cost effective topology is formed. A region-aided routing scheme is further deigned and implemented to realize loop-free, minimum path cost and high scalability for irregular WiNoC infrastructure. To implement the data transmission protocol, the RF microarchitecture of WiNoC is developed where the RF nodes are designed to fulfill the functions of distributed table routing, multi-channel arbitration, virtual output queuing, and distributed flow control. Our simulation studies based on synthetic traffics demonstrate the network efficiency and scalability of WiNoC."

This research area seems to be the next logical step in context-aware computing, which, until a few years ago, had been concerned more with the present and the past temporal dimensions. Most of research works related to context prediction employ the same algorithm for all cases. We did not find any approach that automatically decides the best prediction method according to the situation. Therefore, we propose the ORACON model. ORACON adapts itself in order to apply the best algorithm to the case. This adaptive behavior is the main contribution of this work and differentiates the proposed model of other related works. Furthermore, ORACON supports other important aspects of ubiquitous computing, such as, context formal representation and privacy. We have built a functional prototype that allowed us to conduct two experiments. The first experiment successfully tested the main functionalities provided by ORACON to support context prediction and privacy aspects. The test used context histories generated with a location database that contains 22 millions chekins across 220,000 users in the location sharing services Foursquare and Twitter. The second experiment assessed the adaptive feature of the ORACON. The test simulated the behavior of 30 users for a period of 30 days, using context histories generated through the Siafu simulator. This tool generates data for the evaluation and the comparison of machine learning methods in mobile context-aware settings. We concluded that ORACON chose the most accurate prediction algorithm in the simulated scenario, proving that the model reached the main contribution sought by this research."

Energy is often the most stringent constraint, necessitating techniques that facilitate operation in energy-saving modes. Broadcasting, typically over parallel channels, has proven to be an effective method for dissemination of public data to mobile devices. However, the employment of parallel channels introduces challenges associated with channel switching and conflicts due to concurrent accesses to multiple data items that ultimately increase energy consumption and response time. The detrimental effects on energy consumption and response time can be alleviated by scheduling the retrieval of data items in an order that reduces the number of passes over the air channels and channel switching between the parallel channels. In this paper, several scheduling algorithms are proposed and analyzed that achieve the aforementioned objectives. To further improve energy consumption and response time, the scope of our scheduling algorithms has been enhanced by replication of popular data items. The proposed scheduling algorithms, both with and without replication, have been simulated, and simulation results are presented and analyzed. These results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms, compared to some heuristic based methods, have greater impact in reducing energy consumption and response time. This reduction is shown to be more pronounced with replication of data items."

However, research on the impact of personality traits on users' susceptibility to social influence is scarce. To bridge this gap, using a sample of 350 participants, we investigate: (1) the personality-based determinants of users' susceptibility to three social influence strategies—Social Learning, Social Proof and Social Comparison—which are currently being employed in persuasive applications to motivate users to engage in beneficial behaviors; and (2) the moderating effect of gender. Our results reveal that Neuroticism is the most consistent determinant of users’ susceptibility to social influence, followed by Openness and Conscientiousness. Specifically, we found that: (1) individuals who are high in Neuroticism are more likely to be susceptible to all three social influence strategies than individuals who are low in Neuroticism; (2) individuals who are low in Openness are more likely to be susceptible to Social Proof and Social Comparison than individuals who are high in Openness; and (3) individuals who are low in Conscientiousness are more likely to be susceptible to Social Learning and Social Poof than individuals who are high in Conscientiousness. Finally, based on our findings, we provide a number of design guidelines for personalizing persuasive applications to users who are high in Neuroticism, low in Conscientiousness and/or low in Openness."

Lately, augmented reality and multimodal interaction technologies have enabled non-invasive ways to augment human. In this article, we first discuss the field and related terms. We provide relevant definitions based on the present understanding of the field. This is followed by a summary of existing work in augmented senses, action, and cognition.

abstract = "This paper investigates the ant colony optimization (ACO) based routing protocol against holes (or voids) to address user’s connectivity via Pervasive Wireless Sensor Networks (PWSNs). A hole is an area that has no active sensors, which makes a connection between one side of the network and the other side impossible. To avoid such holes, prior works detected them only when packets reached nodes near the hole, called dead-ends. In this case, the packets need to be rerouted, which results in additional communication cost. The ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is known to be suitable for dynamic environments, which makes it a good choice to deal with the hole problem. We study the capability of an ACO-based routing protocol, called the biologically inspired secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP), for resolving this issue. Because of its routing criteria, BIOSARP does not try to detect the holes after their appearance, but rather avoids them. Network simulator 2 (ns-2) is utilized to perform an analysis by adopting a flag-based feedback mechanism in BIOSARP and is further compared with on-demand routing with the void avoidance (ODVA) protocol in terms of the delivery ratio and energy consumption. Findings clearly demonstrate that BIOSARP can efficiently maintain the network prior to any possible hole problems, by switching data forwarding to the most optimal neighboring node. Thus, it can self-adapt to faults appearing in PWSN and efficiently maintains the network communication."

abstract = "Reliability of data transport in low power and lossy networks like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is vital due to its constraint characteristics and high probability of packet loss from wireless environment and congestion. Data caching and transmission rate control mechanisms are independent ways of improving the reliability of transport protocols in WSN as they immediately respond to packet losses in the network. However, these two mechanisms are traditionally designed independently and an appropriate rate control that can potentially improve the performance of cache-based transport protocols has not yet been investigated. In this work, a dynamic source rate control algorithm that utilizes a cache-aware approach was developed wherein cache management policies are employed to notify the relative degree of packet losses and limit the transmission window size. A baseline cache-based transport protocol called DTSN+ is used to implement the rate control algorithm and evaluated under network scenarios that experience packet losses from contention and congestion. The dynamic cache-aware algorithm outperformed other transport protocols in terms of cache utilization by 30%. The algorithm also obtained outstanding throughput, transmission time and fairness performance as compared with the fixed DTSN+ and DTC protocols. This demonstrated that a cache-aware approach can improve the performance of a transport protocol during high levels of packet losses in the network. In the future, these results can serve as an underlying support in designing a new cache-aware congestion control framework that is suitable for transport protocols that employ the use of intermediate caching in WSN."

Previous studies have focused on the physical capability and capacity of the communication technologies, but the equally important development of suitable and efficient semantic content for transmission received notably less attention. Ontology is one promising approach for context modelling in ubiquitous computing environments, and in the transport domain it can be used both for context modelling and semantic contents for vehicular communications. This paper explores the development of an ontological model implementing relative geo-semantic information messages to support vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The proposed ontology model contains classes, objects, their properties/relations as well as some functions and query templates to represent and update the information of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle interactions and behaviour. This model was developed through a scenario enabling the evaluation of traffic conflict resolution approaches, by implementing a set of decision-making processes for intelligent vehicles. Given the scope of the proposed ontology modelling, it shows how vehicular communications can be used to update each vehicle’s context model. This work can be easily extended for more complex interactions among vehicles and the infrastructure."

This paper reports on the findings of a bibliometric study in which these hybrid techniques are combined to: (1) build and visualize the network of publications shaping the intellectual structure of the smart city research field by considering the first two decades of literature dealing with this subject; (2) map the clusters of thematically-related publications; and (3) reveal the emerging development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster represents and the strategic principles they embody. The five development paths which the analysis uncovers and the strategic principles each stands on are then compared by reviewing the most recent literature on smart cities. Overall, this bibliometric study offers a systematic review of the research on smart cities produced since 1992 and helps bridge the division affecting this research area, demonstrating that it is caused by the dichotomous nature of the development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster relates to and the strategic principles they in turn support."

Furthermore, instrumentation of complex body sensor network at population scale is impractical. In this work, we take an alternative approach of leveraging rich, dynamic, and crowd-generated self-report data from social media platforms as the basis for in-situ activity recognition. By treating the user as the “sensor”, we make use of implicit signals emitted from natural use of mobile smartphones, in the form of textual content, semantic location, and time. Tackling both the task of recognizing a main activity (multi-class classification) and recognizing all applicable activity categories (multi-label tagging) from one instance, we are able to obtain mean accuracies of more than 75%. We conduct a thorough analysis and interpret of our model to illustrate a promising first step towards comprehensive, high-level activity recognition using instrumentation-free, crowdsourced, social media data."

Analysing this data, we first construct a time-varying Origin–Destination matrix that describes how individual pedestrians in our city move at different times and places. We compare this ground-truth against a random pedestrian model to investigate how the latter underestimates or overestimates movement at various locations or times of day. By identifying these deviations, we can calibrate a weighted model that uses POIs from OpenStreetMap to adjust the simulated crowd. Our results show a significant accuracy improvement over the random model, while at the same time our work is readily applicable to simulating crowds in other cities (real and virtual) as long as POI can be defined spatially."

IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text.

In this paper, a clustering-based and QoS-aware services composition algorithm (CQCA) is proposed. To increase the composition optimality and reduce the composition time, the candidate services are first partitioned into clusters, where each cluster represents a QoS level. In addition, a new formulation of the utility function based on the use of the characteristics of the resulting clusters is proposed to remove unpromising candidate services in terms of QoS. A lexicographic optimization method is then exploited to filter out candidate services that have low QoS attributes values. Finally, a search tree is constructed to find near-to-optimal compositions. The obtained performance shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms other composition approaches by finding very near-to-optimal compositions in a reduced composition time."

This situation challenges the viability of health and social services. Smart home technology can play a significant role in easing the pressure on caregivers, as well as reduce the financial costs of health and social services. Activity of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an essential step to translate sensor data into activities at high semantic levels. Supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are the most commonly used techniques for this application. However, a common problem is a lack of availability of enough annotated data to train these algorithms. Collecting annotated data is expensive, time consuming, and may violate people’s privacy. Intra- and inter-personal variation in performing complex activities is another challenge for an ML-based activity recognition approach. In this paper, a multi-layered knowledge-based architecture for recognising ADL in real-time is proposed. At the first stage, sensor data is pre-processed; events that describe changes in the environment are detected at the second stage, in which the sequence of events is used to recognise more semantically complex activities at the third stage. A new ADL ontology is proposed to model the knowledge related to the sensor platform and the targeted activities as the previously proposed ontologies were either designed to deal with specific sensor data, or they ignored the context environment information which is important in recognising complex activities."

However, their impact has been marginal. This paper instead examines the extent to which fully automated vehicles could contribute to the environmental sustainability of global passenger transport. Fully automated vehicles were found to lead to either an increase or, at best, a slight decrease in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and so will be of marginal use at best for reducing emissions in a business-as-usual world. Reasons for this conclusion are first, their potentially lower time and money costs would tend to increase vehicular travel, offsetting any energy efficiency gains, and second, that they face serious problems that could delay or even prevent their widespread introduction."

However, effective use of robotic agents typically requires the user to issue control commands in the form of speech, gesture, or text. Thus, for unskilled or impaired users, the need for a paradigm of intuitive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is prevalent. It can be inferred that the most productive interactions are those in which the assistive agent is able to ascertain the intention of the user. Also, to perform a task, the agent must know the user's area of attention in three-dimensional space. Eye gaze tracking can be used as a method to determine a specific Volume of Interest (VOI). However, gaze tracking has heretofore been under-utilized as a means of interaction and control in 3D space. This research aims to determine a practical volume of interest in which an individual's eyes are focused by combining past methods in order to achieve greater effectiveness. The proposed method makes use of eye vergence as a useful depth discriminant to generate a tool for improved robot path planning. This research investigates the accuracy of the Vector Intersection (VI) model when applied to a usably large workspace volume. A neural network is also used in tandem with the VI model to create a combined model. The output of the combined model is a VOI that can be used as an aid in a number of applications including robot path planning, entertainment, ubiquitous computing, and others."

Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL."

abstract = "In today's competitive world, service providers need to be customer-focused and proactive in their marketing strategies to create consumer awareness of their services. Cloud computing provides an open and ubiquitous computing feature in which a large random number of consumers can interact with providers and request services. In such an environment, there is a need for intelligent and efficient methods that increase confidence in the successful achievement of business requirements. One such method is the Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is comprised of service objectives, business terms, service relations, obligations and the possible action to be taken in the case of SLA violation. Most of the emphasis in the literature has, until now, been on the formation of meaningful SLAs by service consumers, through which their requirements will be met. However, in an increasingly competitive market based on the cloud environment, service providers too need a framework that will form a viable SLA, predict possible SLA violations before they occur, and generate early warning alarms that flag a potential lack of resources. This is because when a provider and a consumer commit to an SLA, the service provider is bound to reserve the agreed amount of resources for the entire period of that agreement – whether the consumer uses them or not. It is therefore very important for cloud providers to accurately predict the likely resource usage for a particular consumer and to formulate an appropriate SLA before finalizing an agreement. This problem is more important for a small to medium cloud service provider which has limited resources that must be utilized in the best possible way to generate maximum revenue. A viable SLA in cloud computing is one that intelligently helps the service provider to determine the amount of resources to offer to a requesting consumer, and there are number of studies on SLA management in the literature. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, it presents a comprehensive overview of existing state-of-the-art SLA management approaches in cloud computing, and their features and shortcomings in creating viable SLAs from the service provider's viewpoint. From a thorough analysis, we observe that the lack of a viable SLA management framework renders a service provider unable to make wise decisions in forming an SLA, which could lead to service violations and violation penalties. To fill this gap, our second contribution is the proposal of the Optimized Personalized Viable SLA (OPV-SLA) framework which assists a service provider to form a viable SLA and start managing SLA violation before an SLA is formed and executed. The framework also assists a service provider to make an optimal decision in service formation and allocate the appropriate amount of marginal resources. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in forming viable SLAs through experiments. From the evaluative results, we observe that our framework helps a service provider to form viable SLAs and later to manage them to effectively minimize possible service violation and penalties."

However, there is a lack of common references and structured protocols for the assessment of workers’ experience in industrial practices in an effective and predictive way. As a result, designers are poorly supported in the application of digital technologies, which are demonstrating to have a great potential. This ascertainment suggested defining a reference model to analyse the so-called user experience (UX) of workers and a proper technological set-up based on virtual simulations in order to support human-centred product-process design. Indeed, the recent advances in ubiquitous computing, wearable technologies and low-cost connected devices offer a huge amount of new tools for human data monitoring. However, the open issue is selecting the most proper devices for industrial application area in respect with design goals, using virtual simulation and digital manufacturing tools. The research proposed a structured procedure to use existing digital technologies to support product-process design to analyse the workers behaviours and assess the perceived experience for industrial scopes. The paper defined a structured protocol analysis to objectify and measure the workers’ experience with the final aim to support the requirements definition in product-process design by using digital technologies. In particular, the model has been defined for the automotive sector. The paper contribution is the definition of the protocol analysis and the development of a mixed reality (MR) set-up to involve real users’ and to improve the digital models. Such a protocol has been applied to different industrial cases related to product and process design, developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial. The comparison with traditional design procedures highlighted the benefits of adopting virtual mock-up and digital simulation within a MR environment to shorten design time and improve the design overall quality."

abstract = "This era of ubiquitous computing has led to the development of complex communication networks all over the world. Wireless sensors, due to their wide applicability, form a key component of any complex network. But, security is a major challenge in making wireless sensor networks robust. Many remote user authentication schemes have been proposed for authenticating the legitimate users of a wireless sensor network. Most of the recently proposed schemes are vulnerable to one or more security attacks and are inefficient in terms of processing time. In this paper, the scheme proposed by Xue et al. has been reviewed and it has been found that the scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack, stolen smart card attack, server spoofing attack. This paper proposes a robust and efficient password based authentication scheme which is secure against all well known security attacks. Moreover, the scheme has a low computation and communication cost and does not suffer from time synchronization problem. A formal security analysis has been performed using AVISPA tool to prove the security of the protocol."
